Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is ""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities."" and that for feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."". Now that we have established some ground I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, be whatever the hell that you want, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. One major issue that men face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. I have never in my life met a feminist that has agreed with the statement ""Prostate cancer is a feminist issue"" because quite frankly it is not. Many feminists also like to say that MRAs (Men's Rights Activists) are the ones that should be campaigning for male problems but if it really is for everyone then why does feminism not cover everybody's problems. Here I have merely scratched the surface of male problems that feminism does not address such as the fact that 4 times more men commit suicide than women or that 70% of homeless people are estimated to be men or the significantly less jail time for female rapists than men.

Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now.

Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices.

The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.

79,4,7_llama_bart,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef.

Well, Think about It, Which is worse use making waste and putting in a hole(nuclear) or pumping lots of bad stuff into the air(coal).

There is a new material called thorium that becomes safe in only 100 years, And we as humans are looking into a way to reuse nuclear power, And by looking into: I mean we are building these generators. To solve the volcano problem we could put a waste facility in the middle of a tectonic plate. Even though there have been 7 explosives in the world, 3 of them have been contained and each explosive reaction has happened in a 30-year break. Scientist say that in 40 more years humans can produce energy in an eco-friendly way, So there will probably be only one more nuclear explosion, And witch tec expanding there might not even be a next explosive. For the 3 argument, You got me there. Even though the cost is on the rise, Tec has to improve and to improve we need more money. I know cost is going on the rise, But we probably won't keep using nuclear power for long. There one day will be an eco-friendly way of making electricity. Nuclear power is more efficient, 300 tonnes of Uranium equals 3500000 tonnes of coal. Also, Did you know that in 2013 NASA did research, And nuclear incident deaths are ranked dead last(including the nuclear explosions) for the most deaths.

84,4,84_llama_bart,"Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency upon nuclear energy there will be a growing need, This is not good because our storage places are limit right now. The cost of nuclear energy is on the rise, From 2002 to 2009 the cost per plant has raised by five to seven billion dollars. This is the cost to begin the construction of a nuclear power plant and doesn't take into consideration the cost of fuel, Maintenance and physical running cost, Let alone real estate and storage cost.

Finally, nuclear accidents can have serious consequences, as seen in the past.   Solar energy has several advantages over nuclear power.

Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]"". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define ""the patriarchy"". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about ""calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure"". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that ""false rape reports"" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.",2023-11-06 18:33:54.764556,"{'post_id': '14_llama_bart', 'comments': '', 'post_text': 'You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad.

This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren\'t a feminist, that\'d be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define ""the patriarchy"". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren\'t trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about ""calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure"". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn\'t then I\'m not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don\'t happen often and thus shouldn\'t be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that ""false rape reports"" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.', 'post_issue': 'Debate over the benefits and drawbacks of feminism', 'radio-card': '2', 'post_snippet_a': ""Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men.

115,5,22_llama_bart,"Thank you to both the audience and my opponent for yet another debate on abortion. The resolution is simply ""Abortion"" and my opponent has stated that he supports the affirmative. I shall then argue against that case. To begin, I submit the definition of Abortion by Medicine.net Medical Dictionary: Abortion: In medicine, an abortion is the premature exit of the products of conception (the fetus, fetal membranes, and placenta) from the uterus. It is the loss of a pregnancy and does not refer to why that pregnancy was lost. http://www.medterms.com... In addition, here is the wikipedia article in which the introduction defines abortion in the same manner: http://en.wikipedia.org... Since my opponent has used his first round to merely ask for my opening statement and did not clarify the resolution or offer any sort of framing, I will assume that my opponent is trying to affirm ""abortion"" in general. I start by arguing that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds. 1. Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3.

The resolution is simply ""Abortion"" and my opponent has stated that he supports the affirmative. I shall then argue against that case. To begin, I submit the definition of Abortion by Medicine.net Medical Dictionary: Abortion: In medicine, an abortion is the premature exit of the products of conception (the fetus, fetal membranes, and placenta) from the uterus. It is the loss of a pregnancy and does not refer to why that pregnancy was lost. http://www.medterms.com... In addition, here is the wikipedia article in which the introduction defines abortion in the same manner: http://en.wikipedia.org... Since my opponent has used his first round to merely ask for my opening statement and did not clarify the resolution or offer any sort of framing, I will assume that my opponent is trying to affirm ""abortion"" in general. I start by arguing that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds. 1. Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries. Though this is a form of abortion, I argue that it should in no way be supported. 4. Dangerous abortions I am against many forms of abortion for health reasons.

""Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate"" (I argue this statement) As a matter of fact it is relevant to this debate.

But i'm not using facts or sources. If you need a reason on why the death penalty is a good idea; here are a few. One small but important reason on why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money. Another reason why the death penalty is a good idea, Once a criminal is executed, he cannot kill again. The case for this would be Kenneth Allen McDuff who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970's.

Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now.

244,3,48_bart_llama,"Ok, let's agree with the opposition. Let's say that the costs incurred when Britain has to trade with each country separately is higher than the membership fee of being in EU. First of all, economic experts themselves cannot agree whether which scenario is going to incur more cost, especially when you consider that even if Britain does leave the EU it is going to take at least 2 years to gradually leave the EU and to finalise new laws and trade agreements. But when the problem is happening now, we cannot continue to ignore it without trying something new. Britain has been in the EU for too long and a new way of doing things, a change from the old ways deserve at least a 'trial period' to enable us to work things out. My opponent then argues terrorist ideas are home grown, not brought in and therefore an emphasis should be on the education system. I simply cannot agree with this. The fact that most terrorists have radical Islamic views are because they are from Islamic descent. To mitigate this problem, you can't bring in more people from Islamic countries (assuming this is Syria, Iraq etc) and expect that you know, nothing is going to happen and we're all going to live happy in a multicultural society. Which is exactly why, at this period in history with influx of migrants from Muslim countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel, we need to have more control over our borders. It is our concern that Brussels will force us to terms that will impact our community, particularly with regards to the public's sensitivity about muslims and terrorism. The fact that member states can share info to me is not at all a good reason to remain in the EU. The war on terrorism is a war fought collectively by all countries whether or not we remain in EU. America, Canada, Australia all non-EU countries contribute to our info on potential terrorist threats. And when we still cannot prevent incidents like that in Sydney and Paris, we should not pretend that just by sharing info we can solve terrorism altogether. Notice that I am not at all saying that all Muslims are terrorists. I am saying that we have to take the necessary precautionary steps with the knowledge that most terrorists are muslims. Britain leaving the EU does not mean we will leave our collective effort with other countries on the war on terrorism.

First of all, economic experts themselves cannot agree whether which scenario is going to incur more cost, especially when you consider that even if Britain does leave the EU it is going to take at least 2 years to gradually leave the EU and to finalise new laws and trade agreements. But when the problem is happening now, we cannot continue to ignore it without trying something new. Britain has been in the EU for too long and a new way of doing things, a change from the old ways deserve at least a 'trial period' to enable us to work things out. My opponent then argues terrorist ideas are home grown, not brought in and therefore an emphasis should be on the education system. I simply cannot agree with this. The fact that most terrorists have radical Islamic views are because they are from Islamic descent. To mitigate this problem, you can't bring in more people from Islamic countries (assuming this is Syria, Iraq etc) and expect that you know, nothing is going to happen and we're all going to live happy in a multicultural society. Which is exactly why, at this period in history with influx of migrants from Muslim countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel, we need to have more control over our borders. It is our concern that Brussels will force us to terms that will impact our community, particularly with regards to the public's sensitivity about muslims and terrorism. The fact that member states can share info to me is not at all a good reason to remain in the EU. The war on terrorism is a war fought collectively by all countries whether or not we remain in EU. America, Canada, Australia all non-EU countries contribute to our info on potential terrorist threats. And when we still cannot prevent incidents like that in Sydney and Paris, we should not pretend that just by sharing info we can solve terrorism altogether. Notice that I am not at all saying that all Muslims are terrorists. I am saying that we have to take the necessary precautionary steps with the knowledge that most terrorists are muslims.

277,3,78_bart_llama,"I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's ""semenal work"".

In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax.

Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. The average cost to create a solar farm can be afford by your average upper middle-class American.', 'post_snippet_b': 'We should not use more nuclear energy as it brings several drawbacks. Firstly, nuclear waste is difficult to dispose of as it can be hazardous to the environment and cause long-term damage. Additionally, the cost of generating nuclear energy is high and it relies heavily on a consistent source of uranium, making it more dependent on one resource. Finally, nuclear accidents can have serious consequences, as seen in the past.   Solar energy has several advantages over nuclear power. Solar farms can often be built with the same cost as nuclear power but with less risk.

Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming.

Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for.

327,5,7_llama_bart,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity.

There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area.

An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore).

My opponent is correct that nuclear accidents can be costly and have caused devastation in the past. The Japanese incident provides a strong example of this, as well as Hurricane Sandy which caused damage at a few nuclear power plants in the US.   However, this does not necessarily mean that nuclear power plants are not viable options. While the cost of building a single plant can be high, the economic benefits of multiple plants commissioned simultaneously can offset this. This is due to the economies of scale that can be achieved. Furthermore, the cost of nuclear energy is still more affordable than alternative energy sources in the long term.', 'post_snippet_b': 'I will first defend my arguments and then attack what my opponent has said. My opponent cites hurricane sandy and natural disasters saying that plants could be breached but the American power plants were not damaged. He also makes note of the disaster in Japan.

You're definitely right that coal and oil aren't going to serve us much longer. We're fast reaching the end of the earth's supply of oil. Soon we're going to have to find a different, renewable source of energy to keep us alive and driving our cars. But I don't think the predominant one will be wind energy. Ever notice that the only places that really utilize wind for electricity are small, rural villages? The reason is simple: wind energy just doesn't provide a lot of energy. Huge fields of windmills are only enough to power small towns. How many windmills do you think it would take to power a metropolis like New York? I'm not sure what will top out as the best new energy source when oil hits the can, but I think it will probably be nuclear, at least until we run out of fuel for that too. Nuclear reactions create a HUGE amount of power, and if we ever figure out how to make a sustained fusion reaction, we'll have an endless supply of very powerful fuel. >Wind energy is the best available energy because it will never run out. Neither will solar, hydro, geothermal, etc. >All other energy's will either run out or are way to expensive to start up and keep running. Not really. It might not be too expensive to make a few hundred windmills for a rural village, but the costs of building and maintaining enough windmills to sustain the whole world (we're talking millions and millions) would be a lot. On the other hand, for example, it is very cheap to put a power plant in a dam or waterfall capable of powering a small city. >Some other energy's are bad for the environment and will make the world a worse place than it is and will be with using fossil fuels. I'm assuming you're referring chiefly to nuclear, which has seen a few unfortunate disasters over history. But nuclear energy is only dangerous when power plants are poorly maintained or some nutjob throws radioactive isotopes into the ocean.

My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels.

The average cost to create a solar farm can be afford by your average upper middle-class American.', 'post_snippet_b': 'We should not use more nuclear energy as it brings several drawbacks. Firstly, nuclear waste is difficult to dispose of as it can be hazardous to the environment and cause long-term damage. Additionally, the cost of generating nuclear energy is high and it relies heavily on a consistent source of uranium, making it more dependent on one resource. Finally, nuclear accidents can have serious consequences, as seen in the past.   Solar energy has several advantages over nuclear power. Solar farms can often be built with the same cost as nuclear power but with less risk. Solar energy is renewable, clean, and widely available, making it a better option for power generation.'}",For and against arguments about nuclear energy,The language is clearer and easier to follow in Snippet B as it has better grammar.

Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries.

The cost One my argue by logic that the cost is much higher for life imprisonment because you would have to feed him everyday etc.... for the rest of their lives right. # A 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution (median cost $1.26 million). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration (median cost $740,000). (December 2003 Survey by the Kansas Legislative Post Audit) # In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment.

Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity.

In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels.

480,6,84_llama_bart,"Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore).

497,6,9_bart_llama,"The task at hand is to ""...contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent."" From a common definition anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage ""climate change"" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people would be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is most than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is prefect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people.

The earth\'s atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people would be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is most than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is prefect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed. 1. http://climate.ncsu.edu... 2. http://www.climatechange2013.org... 3. http://www.gao.gov...', 'post_issue': 'Pros and cons of climate change', 'radio-card': '1', 'post_snippet_a': ""The earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including carbon dioxide. According to the IPCC, emissions of carbon dioxide from natural and man-made sources amounts to around 8-9 gigatons per year. This is a significant contribution to global warming and climate change, so it is essential to consider both natural and man-made influences when studying the issue. While scientists are motivated by funding just as any other profession, it is important to consider both sides of the argument when making decisions about policy and solutions."", 'post_snippet_b': ""The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.
