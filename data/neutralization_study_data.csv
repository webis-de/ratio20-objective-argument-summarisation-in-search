And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.","Gun control can be an effective way to reduce crime as it limits access to firearms for potential criminals. While some may argue that criminals will find other weapons, statistics show that gun control does reduce crime rates as criminals are less likely to engage in criminal activity when up against an armed citizen.

In addition, the Second Amendment was incorporated to the states to allow citizens to bear arms in order to provide a check against a potential tyrannical government.

They are racist they abuse and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morales and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head of at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains. ","The argument presented is that the Stormcloaks being portrayed as the exclusive bad guys of the Civil War in Skyrim makes the quest line and story weaker. The main points presented to support this argument are that the Stormcloaks are racist, abusive, and use dark magic, making them the “villains” by modern morales. Additionally, Ulfric's use of the Thu'um to kill the High King further enforces the argument that the Stormcloaks are the antagonists.   To CMV, it could be argued that the Stormcloaks being the only bad guys in the civil war is an oversimplification, and that there is more complexity to the situation. Additionally, it could be argued that the Stormcloaks have their own motivations and perspectives which complicate the situation. Furthermore, it could be argued that the narrative of the Civil War in Skyrim makes clear the moral and ethical grey areas of the conflict, and portrays the Stormcloaks, and Ulfric in particular, as not being as black and white as they initially seem.","I agree that the Stormcloaks' actions make them more clearly villainous than the Imperials, as they are willing to resort to extreme measures such as racism and abuse. This does make the Stormcloaks the more obvious 'bad guys' of the conflict and weakens the storyline. However, I would argue that Ulfric's actions with the Thu'um serve to demonstrate his dedication to his cause, rather than making him the villain of the story.

Laws should be carefully constructed to provide enough protection without infringing on an individual's rights. It is important to consider not only the potential risks but also the potential benefits of any law and its potential effects. In my opinion, it is important to evaluate the law carefully in order to make sure it is the best option. While it is difficult to predict the long term effects of a law, it is important to ensure that the legislators have as much information as possible in order to make an informed decision. Ultimately, it is important to consider both the pros and cons of any law before making a decision.","I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.

I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm.

People — voters or legislators — pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects.

Police officers have the power to detain and arrest people, which can have a much greater impact on an individual’s life than an insurance company’s decision to charge more for a policy. This makes law enforcement more accountable and subject to greater scrutiny than insurance companies.

To really properly analize these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point).

It can be difficult to decipher between legitimate injuries and exaggerated ones, which can give a poor image to the sport overall. In football, basketball, and other sports, players are able to brush off the bump and go back into the game without receiving a yellow card, which is effective in punishing any foul while also allowing the player to remain in the game. This can provide a good balance between punishing offenses and allowing players to remain in the game.","I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall.

Additionally, these athletes serve as role models for many young children; do we really want kids to aspire to have high-pitched voices and develop breast tissue by using steroids? If we legalize performance enhancing drugs, we will see an influx in their use in both professional and non-professional athletes.

In the early 80s while on hunger strike, Bobby Sands and other IRA members were denied the title of political prisoners, resulting in their deaths. This was a difficult and controversial decision, as it caused a great deal of anguish across the UK.   Whilst this was undoubtedly a difficult period for the UK, it is important to remember that many parts of Britain experienced a great deal of decline in their industries during this time, which was further exacerbated by a number of external factors. Despite this, the UK was still able to make a successful recovery.  It is clear that Thatcher's decisions were not universally popular, however it is also important to recognize the positive changes that she was able to implement in order to help bring about a UK recovery.

We know cosleeping carries some risks, such as babies rolling or falling out of beds or disrupting the parent's intimacy. It is important to be mindful of these risks and make sure to create a safe sleep environment for the infant. While it may be difficult to establish a routine initially, it is recommended to try and slowly transition the infant to their own bed. This can be easier said than done and may require some trial and error. However, basinet bassinets are a useful tool to help make the transition smoother. They are smaller and more lightweight than traditional cribs and can be easily moved to fit the sleeping arrangements.

Jon Jax 71","The Cold War is over, and trade and travel between Cuba and the US are now possible. After over 48 years of the same policy in place, it is clear that it has not had the desired effect of opening Cuban society or increasing US business involvement. Both countries would benefit from a new approach which allows normal relations, trade and travel between the two countries.  It is clear that the current policy has not achieved its goals and it is time to move on and build a new relationship between the two nations.","Is it time to end  the cuban blockade?   stance: time to move on, allow normal relations, trade & travel with cuba.:",2
