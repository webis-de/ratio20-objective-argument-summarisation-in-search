{"document": "The task at hand is to \"contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent\". From a common definition, anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage, \"climate change\" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task.  The Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2. Assume, for this paragraph only, that the small trace gas of CO2 (0.04%) is the cause of global warming.  The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would, by a most rational person, be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC, 800 gigatons of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually. Most rational people would consider a source that is more than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people may try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause.   This indicates that manmade sources of CO2 emission contribute roughly 3.62% to the total CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is impossible to say that manmade sources are not a significant contributor to global warming.   Overall, it is clear that manmade sources of CO2 emission are a significant factor in climate change.

{"document": "Definitions: Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals http://en.wikipedia.org... In modern society, the production of consumer goods is often driven by profits and market demands. This can lead to exploitation of animals, both in terms of the resources used to produce the goods, as well as the animals themselves who are used as a source of food or resources. As vegans, we recognise this and seek to reduce the exploitation of animals, while still being able to meet our needs. We believe that vegetarian and vegan diets offer a more ethical approach as they do not require the use of animal products.   In addition to dietary choices, vegans also try to reduce their consumption of animal products in other areas, such as clothing and homeware. While it is impossible to eliminate all animal products from our lives, vegans strive to reduce their consumption and support businesses and brands that reduce animal exploitation.   The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain\u2019t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: \u201cIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\u201d Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.   It is clear that veganism is not only ethically sound, but also allows for mutual respect and harmony between all sentient beings. As vegans, we must strive to be conscious of the products we use and the effect they have on animals, people and the environment. Veganism is an ethical and sustainable lifestyle choice which allows us to live in harmony with the world.", "reference": "Veganism is the practice of abstaining from animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy which advocates for the respect and consideration of all sentient beings.

{"document": "I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's \"semenal work\". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is \"seminal\", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious.   Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then \"finish the job\" by swallowing his muck will \"remove antagonism\" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. So, by choosing to swallow her sire's semen vegan women are deliberately breaking their vow not to consume animal products and are, therefore, hypocrites.   [1] I expect. [2] Probably.    In conclusion, it is clear that a vegan woman cannot expect to receive the same nutrition from a vegetarian diet due to the variation in the amount of protein available in different food sources. Therefore, in order to receive the same nutrition as her boyfriend, she may need to consume animal products on occasion, therefore making it difficult for her to adhere to a vegetarian diet.  Overall, it is clear that veganism requires an understanding of different nutritional needs, as well as flexibility in diet in order to meet these needs.", "reference": "I dispute my opponent's claim that love ice cream is not a commodity.

We should not rely too heavily on nuclear energy for several reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not as efficient because it is short lived and can pose risks to living organisms as they break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us as plants and animals receive them. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea as it pushes the waste away from us, however there is still some uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of this storage and the creation of new land masses due to volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world, with many long-term effects still unknown. In addition, until we are better educated on the subject, nuclear energy should be used with caution and with greater regulation. Renewable energy sources are becoming more cost effective as they continue to develop, such as solar farms which can be built by average upper-middle-class Americans.

Ultimately, it is important for individuals to examine the policies and views of each candidate in order to decide who to support.   Thank you for considering this viewpoint.   Sincerely,  Drago 31", "reference": "Donald Trump has been accused of being racist due to his comments about certain racial groups, which suggest that he perceives them as lazier and less hardworking than others. He has also been accused of being a liar for claiming that he is the \"least racist person\".", "neutralized_summarized": "Donald Trump is not a liar for thinking that he is the \"least racist person\" as racism is subjective and depends on one\u2019s own experience and perspective. It is important for individuals to examine the policies and views of each candidate in order to decide who to support."}
{"document": "qwzx has accepted this debate with knowledge that this results in automatic loss, as dictated by rule 6. However, he's trying to argue his case that I was not specific enough on what exactly you will lose. Any person with common sense would be able to know that I meant he would lose the debate by accepting. However, it is possible that I may have intended to refer to Donald Trump specifically, as there are distinct similarities between the two. This could have been more clearly stated by including his middle name. In this case, it could be argued that I still would have lost the debate even if I had specified the middle name due to the similarities between the two. However, it is also possible that I may have been referring to a different president altogether, so it is difficult to definitively say that I would have lost the debate if I had been more specific. Therefore, I believe the argument can go either way and it is impossible to definitively say which side would have won.", "reference": "I did not specify that I was talking about Donald Trump, the current President of the United States.", "neutralized_summarized": "Qwzx has accepted this debate with knowledge that this results in automatic loss.

{"document": "Although I do agree with your stance on Donald Trump's economic benefits, he has no sense of humanity. A POTUS must have the ability to connect and relate to the people of The United States of America, regardless of age, race, gender, or ability. The fact that Trump has already caused protests, including the organization of the Women's March, further proves that Trump is not the right leader for the country. Furthermore, the president should act as a role model for all citizens, regardless of whether it is part of the job description. It is essential that the President promotes equality and kindness, as this is an important element of the presidency that must not be overlooked.    Whilst Trump's business background may prove beneficial to the economy, it is important to consider the wider needs of the country and its citizens. This must be taken into consideration when selecting a president, in order to ensure that all elements of the presidency are taken into account and to ensure the best outcome for the country.", "reference": "A President is elected to lead all citizens of the United States, and it is important for a president to be able to connect and relate to all Americans.", "neutralized_summarized": "A POTUS must have the ability to connect and relate to the people of The United States of America.

{"document": "Sadly, illegal immigration has become a major issue in the US Presidential election and has caused a divide amongst voters. While it is important to address the issue of immigration, it is essential to take a thoughtful and compassionate approach that takes into account the impact it may have on families, communities and the economy. It is essential to strike a balance between controlling our borders and ensuring that those who are seeking better lives can do so in a safe and legal way. It is up to our leaders to provide a solution that meets the needs of the US and its citizens.\u201d  It is clear that immigration is an important issue and one that requires a thoughtful and well-informed approach. Ultimately, it is up to the government to find a suitable solution that takes all factors into consideration. It is important that the approach taken is both effective and humane.", "reference": "Hillary Clinton accused Trump of being a racist, which Trump denies. Clinton has faced criticism for her comments and Trump noted that she was likely attempting to boost her own standing in the Democratic primary. He suggested that she was acting out of desperation and suggested that he was a better candidate than Bush. It appears that Trump believes that he is best positioned to win the nomination, as he has been successful in drawing attention to himself.", "neutralized_summarized": "It is essential to strike a balance between controlling our borders and ensuring that those who are seeking better lives can do so in a safe and legal way.

{"document": "Well I think if Donald Trump does not win the election, then the Democrats will have a much easier time finding solutions that benefit the people. I recognize that Trump has helped to shine a light on certain issues and brought them to the forefront, which is necessary in order to make positive changes. However, I believe it is important to look for solutions that take a holistic approach and focus on the long term. I think Trump's actions show a lack of respect for other countries and do not take into account the needs of other countries and their citizens. I believe it is important to have a balanced approach that is sensitive to the needs of all. In this way, we can truly make progress and ensure a better future for everyone.", "reference": "I don't agree with his methods, but it is important to recognize that President Trump has been honest in his approach.
