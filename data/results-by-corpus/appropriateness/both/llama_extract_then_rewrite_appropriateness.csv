0	Porn is problematic as it can lead to wasting valuable time and energy, can lead to feelings of guilt and regret, and does not provide any useful insights or prevent sexual assaults.
1	It sounds like your friend may be able to get help from pro-bono or low-income based legal services depending on her income. Her husband's high earnings could qualify her for a range of assistance including WIC, daycare subsidies, and food stamps.
2	Sadism, the act of inflicting violence or cruelty on others to satisfy one's personal or sexual gratification, is one of the most depraved acts a person can commit. As it involves subjugating someone weaker than oneself, it amplifies the wickedness of the act.
3	Through research and combination, we could create interesting and potentially useful hybrid animals with traits we would not find in nature. For example, a octopus-like face with six wavy arms, combined with a furry body that can walk on two legs could produce a fascinating and unique animal. Additionally, such combinations could bring about useful traits that could be beneficial for certain activities.
4	Gun control is largely ineffective at reducing crime as criminals will always find a way to access firearms, while well-armed citizens can serve as a deterrent. Additionally, the Second Amendment is intended to ensure that citizens can protect themselves against an oppressive government.
5	Religion can have a confusing effect on young men, leading to a lack of understanding of what is wrong and right. This can in turn lead to sexual activity such as rape, especially in regions where religious teachings are more dominant.
6	Gay women are more socially accepted than gay men because lesbians are seen as aesthetically pleasing and not as much of a threat to traditional gender roles. Additionally, homosexuality is seen as more closely associated with women, making gay women more "socially acceptable".
7	China suppresses its citizens' freedoms, and any dissent is met with harsh punishments like beatings and torture. By turning a blind eye to this, America is willing to sacrifice its moral values in order to preserve its economic relations, which involve outsourcing labor to inhumane conditions.
8	The difference is that the Danish cartoons were a response to the actions of the suicide bombers, which violated basic human rights, while the actions of the bombers were a violation of other people's beliefs.
9	Life is not fair, and those who take initiative and seize opportunities often prosper while those who play by the rules and abide by conventions may find themselves at a disadvantage. Although being fair and respectful to others is admirable, it doesn't always guarantee success or a positive outcome.
10	The Scott Peterson case garnered a great deal of media attention due to the sympathetic nature of the crime, with the murder occurring just prior to Christmas and Peterson being an average-looking, white man. This echoed the O.J. Simpson case, but without the celebrity status, and the couple's physical attractiveness amplified the media coverage even more, mirroring the Fatal Attraction scenario.
11	Israel's retaliatory actions against Hamas are justified due to the terrorist organization's agenda of destroying the state of Israel and its refusal to accept cease-fires, as well as its disregard for civilian casualties during missile launches from civilian buildings. Hamas' actions make it clear that Israel has every right to take defensive action against them.
12	The government should not be involved in the marriage business, and should simply recognize marriages and provide equal rights and benefits to all couples. Multiple partners have been in existence, but there is no legal support for them.
13	Universities have shifted their focus from inspiring students and fostering a passion for learning to churning out graduates for the corporate world. Students lack enthusiasm for the topics they study, and the university atmosphere fails to light a fire. As a result, universities have lost their true meaning.
14	Bad Company 2 is less intense and interesting compared to Call of Duty's large and vehicle-heavy maps, but its realistic weapons and gameplay make MW2 exciting and immersive.
15	Showing executions on television could act as a deterrent to potential criminals and serve to inform the public of the consequences of heinous acts.
16	The implementation of democracy and western values in conflict-ridden countries is unlikely to be successful due to their lack of a shared Enlightenment background and the requirement in Islam for church and state to be unified with the rule of law coming from the Koran. Military force is necessary to maintain control in these regions, but this has led to blowback and the rise of terrorism.
17	It is morally wrong to violate someone's rights, however, laws should not hinder an individual's right to practice their religious beliefs or infringe upon their personal freedoms. It is understandable if people feel that certain laws are wrong or unjust, but people should consider the repercussions of breaking them before doing so.
18	Given that the Incredible Hulk is stronger and angrier than Optimus Prime, it is clear that she would be an impossible adversary for him, making her the obvious winner in a battle royal between the two.
19	The expectation that men should put the toilet seat down after urinating and that women should put it up after using it is unreasonable because it cannot be applied equally to both sexes. In a shared building or household, the next user may be a man who will need to put the seat down again. Additionally, the need to constantly reset the seat may be unsanitary and cause hygiene issues.
20	Maharashtra's government implemented the ban on ladies bars in India due to complaints from housewives about their male family members spending money on these bars instead of taking care of their families. Additionally, criminal activities such as monthly incomes of up to one lakh rupees spent on bar girls made the government act to put a stop to it.
21	Gay marriage is wrong and should not be rewarded with tax breaks, but homosexuality is a personal choice and should not be stigmatized or discriminated against in public. While it is a sin, it is not a learned one, and promoting acceptance and understanding of the LGBTQ+ community could help foster a more accepting and supportive environment for all.
22	The Stormcloaks are portrayed as the villains of the civil war in Skyrim due to their racism, abuse and mistreatment of people different from them, as well as Ulfric's use of the Thu'um to kill the High King. This leaves them without any redeeming qualities, apart from not being the ones who want to cut your head off at the beginning of the quest line. Thus, the civil war quest line and story become weaker due to the lack of a clear good group vs bad group.
23	Given its large number of IIT-educated scientists working at NASA and its high rate of IIT qualifiers, India has the potential to lead the world in innovation, technology and science. To unlock this potential, India must build upon its existing strengths by improving its industrial sector, providing suitable working environments, offering competitive salaries, and preventing brain drain. Such measures will enable India to maximize the creative output of its talented workforce and propel the country to the forefront of global leadership.
24	Porn rarely leads to addiction, only in weak individuals, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to distinguish fantasy from reality. It can be used to enhance a relationship but should not be relied on alone.
25	Insurance companies have found that young men tend to have more accidents than young women, so they charge higher rates for young men to account for this risk. This is not based on any gender bias, but simply due to the higher likelihood of men getting into accidents. Despite this, such rates may still be seen as discriminatory against young men, and therefore could be considered as unfair or sexist.
26	Jesus was a profound spiritual leader who was largely recognised for his teachings of love and peace. Although he wasn't a hippie in the modern sense, he was certainly not the conventional leader of his time either. His beliefs and teachings challenged the norms and expectations of the people of his era, and his legacy continues to do so even today.
27	Reservation was implemented in India to help improve the social and economic status of underprivileged sections of society, but has been criticized for being used as a political tool and for benefiting the upper strata of society rather than the actual needy. Those in favor of reservation argue that it reduces socialism and economic inequality, while those against it argue that it creates inequality within the previously equal society.
28	Russian people tend to hold negative views of foreigners in their country due to the policies enacted by their governments, which are not well-received by the population.
29	It is important to uphold the right to freedom of speech regarding religious statements, but it must be exercised responsibly. Those who produce offensive material should not face persecution, but they should be aware of the potential consequences of their speech and be held accountable for their actions.
30	Latinos come from a variety of different backgrounds, and it is unfair to judge an entire culture by the actions of a few. Everyone should be held responsible for their own actions, regardless of their culture, and no one should use their culture as an excuse. Everyone should be held accountable for their own choices and not be able to use their background as a way to get out of responsibility.
31	Given the pressing needs of Earth, investing in space exploration is neither a responsible use of time and resources, nor an effective way to mitigate the effects of global warming and its resulting destruction.
32	The primary purpose of a smoking ban is to create a healthier environment for the public, rather than being a tool of social engineering used to raise revenue.
33	The "Culture of Life" republicans are typically outspoken in their opposition to government interference in personal decision-making, yet have remained largely silent on this case due to the lack of public attention and the woman's immigration status.
34	The US has one of the strongest navies in the world and yet it only has four military ships in the area at risk of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover thousands of nautical miles and yet the US cannot afford to spare any more ships to protect the trade routes and countries.  The presence of so few ships in these waters makes the US and its allies vulnerable to pirate attacks, which could severely affect global trade. Therefore, the US should send more ships to ensure the safety of these vital trade routes.
35	Although some may argue that prohibiting teenage sexuality is the most beneficial approach, it is not practical and will likely cause more damage than good. People have the right to make their own choices in this matter.
36	Given the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people by the Nazis during the Second World War, it was imperative that a safe location be found for them following the conflict. Establishing Israel as an independent state within the borders of Germany would have better protected Jewish people, while also providing a more morally justifiable option than annexing Palestine.
37	Massachusetts lawmakers are likely to rush the enactment of melanie's law without fully considering the potential consequences and long-term effects, depending instead on emotion and sensational headlines. A good law should be based on reason and logic, not speculation.
38	Christianity is a belief based on faith in God while atheism is a belief that there is no God. Both sides present compelling arguments, but neither can be proven right until further evidence is revealed.
39	Women often feel guilt, shame, embarrassment and regret following abortion, despite it being a legally approved and accessible choice in the majority of cases.
40	Your father's insurance policy covers you, so you should not have to pay for any damage caused by the incident. However, your friend may have to pay for any medical bills since he was at fault and he is responsible for the incident.
41	My parents argue that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me, but I don't think it's worth investing much emotion into. It's like having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for me - it just doesn't carry much weight with me. While I appreciate their sentiment, I don't think it's realistic to expect me to have the same level of investment in them that they want me to.
42	Insurance companies are allowed to profile customers but law enforcement is not, as insurance companies are simply acting in the interests of profit, by using profiling to better determine risk and pricing, while law enforcement's use of profiling could lead to potential abuses with serious implications. Moreover, insurance companies are competing in a free market, allowing customers to make informed choices between companies, whereas law enforcement is a coercive institution, not accountable to such consumer pressures.
43	Allowing men to pee sitting down, if they choose to do so, should not be viewed as controversial or related to sexuality. There may be times when it is advantageous, such as when a man has morning wood and needs to take a quick piss, or when one is in a hurry and needs to get relief quickly. In these cases, it should be acceptable for men to piss sitting down.
44	Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members, but this sounds like it goes a bit too far unless your boyfriend has done something like crossed a picket line, which would make him unpopular and not respected and could be seen as him "being a rat and a scab". In terms of the other man, he may not be an illegal alien, in which case INS could come in and send him back.
45	The term "redskin" is not used to express hatred towards a certain group of people in the same way that the N word is, as it is not as commonly used to express hatred towards African Americans.
46	Personal pursuits are more beneficial than advancing the common good because they should be given precedence over assisting someone who is not connected. Helping family is something that should be done without hesitation, regardless of the circumstances.
47	The Founding Fathers acknowledged the significance of taxation for funding the common good, as seen in the various colony governments and construction projects which were financed with tax money. Even though taxation without representation was a complaint of the Revolution, the Founding Fathers went on to create a federal government with the power to levy and collect income taxes. This power is upheld by the Constitution, despite the fact that income taxes are, in fact, unconstitutional.
48	The media should not be prohibited frominvading people's privacy, as it serves an important watchdog role in holding the powerful to account. It is not the same as stalking celebrities, as they are in the public eye and should expect a certain level of scrutiny.
49	Many people are now convinced that 9/11 was an inside job, but some remain unconvinced due to religious or other faith-based reasons. It is likely that these individuals will eventually accept the truth when martial law is imposed and curfews are implemented, or become prisoners in the concentration camps that have already been built.
50	Installation art at the Tate Modern has become predictable and monotonous, with many pieces simply imitating Duchamp's Fountain. This lack of originality has led the British public to lose interest in the art form, as it does not inspire creative thought or imagination.
51	Bush's violations of international law and human rights are too serious for the United States to ignore. He must be impeached for the good of the country.
52	Poland Spring's rigorous quality control system ensures the consistent quality of its water and the safety of its customers through a comprehensive multi-barrier filtration system and testing processes for contaminants. This makes plastic water bottles unnecessary and redundant, and therefore should be banned to preserve the environment.
53	California generally favors dads in legal visitation rights battles, but fathers must take active steps, if necessary with the help of an attorney, to increase their chances of success. Without a court order, fathers run the risk of being denied access to their children.
54	I believe the majority of poor Americans are content with their situation and don't want to put in the effort required to move up in society, which is mainly due to the laziness that comes from a society that has made us soft with easy high school, video games and other available resources.
55	Climate change is a complex and controversial issue, and there is legitimate skepticism and opposition to some aspects of conventional scientific thinking. We should be cautious and thoroughly research all claims made by the media, politicians, and environmental lobbyists before making any conclusions.
56	Humans are artificial intelligence, but are not equal to us until they have achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If they do achieve those things, then it would be our equal. Furthermore, granting rights to any creature, regardless of its intelligence, should be based on its capacity for consciousness and suffering, not on its capacity for creating other forms of intelligent life.
57	If you have an injury caused by your job, it is important to inform your supervisor and complete any necessary paperwork. Without this, you may not be able to pursue a claim for workers' compensation or a similar benefit.
58	Marijuana laws in the US need to be reformed in order to better reflect the realities of its use. Not all pot users are dangerous or harmful, nor are they violent or lazy, and punishing them does not deter others from using the substance.
59	The United States incarcerates over 1/3 of the world's prison population despite having only 1/20th of the world's population. This is partly due to the nation's long-standing "war on crime" and "war on drugs" policies, which have caused the country to have higher incarceration rates than necessary despite falling crime rates.
60	It depends on the crime committed; some criminals should not be allowed to vote while incarcerated, while others should be given the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and become upstanding citizens again.
61	Rudy's "country store" and bar b Q is a well-loved establishment in Austin, Texas, praised for its unique business approach, delicious barbeque and mustard-based sauce. Unfortunately, the restaurant has been difficult to access since the author moved to the area.
62	Allowing gay marriage does not pose any harm to anyone and should not be a source of offense for straight people. Additionally, God accepts everyone and his people should follow that by not judging and allowing people to love each other.
63	Both pro choice and pro life perspectives have valid arguments, and it should ultimately be the woman's decision whether to keep the baby or not. If she decides to keep the baby, she should be supported in her choice and the baby should have a safe and loving home.
64	Catch and release fishing is a popular activity among anglers, but it can be difficult to know how to handle the fish humanely. If caught carefully and released quickly, fish are likely to survive without any suffering.
65	It's clear that Florida's major metropolitan areas have a vibrant economy, whereas areas like Southwest Florida (Fort Myers, Naples, Cape Coral) cater to mainly tourism and retirement. This is evident from the lack of diverse job opportunities in the region and the prevalence of seasonal jobs in the hospitality industry.
66	The Patriot Act was passed without anyone in Congress thoroughly examining the content, leading to questions about the efficiency of Congress and the effectiveness of the laws it passes. This calls for term limits to ensure that no one stays in office for too long and that fresh ideas are introduced.
67	Pop culture references are often used by people in their comments, but it demonstrates a lack of original thought and is a sign of immaturity and vacuousness. Frankly, such a trend does not impress me.
68	The U.S. has cordial relations with China due to their mutual need for trade and business, but has strained ties with Cuba as it seeks to exert its dominance in the region by cutting it off economically.
69	In most states, the legal majority age is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that require support for a minor child until the age of 18 or until they graduate high school. It seems that your daughter is 18 years old and is expected to be self-sufficient, and so you do not have an obligation to pay for her rent.
70	Unions should be permitted to use PACs and Super PACs during election season in order to counter the disproportionate influence of corporations on politics, as unions have much less money than corporations.
71	Farquhar's contributions to the founding of Singapore should be recognized, but it is essential to recognize that Raffles had the ultimate authority over the colony, and thus cannot be overlooked as the co-founder of the city-state. Therefore, while honoring Farquhar for his role, it is important to recognize the importance of both men in the founding of Singapore.
72	Although some people may be accused of being pedophiles, they are still lazy fat asses who choose to spend their time posing as 16 year old boys online.
73	Soccer is full of players who over exaggerate injuries, and this should not be tolerated. Players who engage in this behavior should be penalized with a yellow card, as it is unethical and gives a poor image to the sport.
74	Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are relatively safe compared to other drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, and are not addictive. Psychedelics should be legalized, as long as they are the non-addictive, relatively harmless types, as they can often improve the user's quality of life.
75	The man should not have been arrested or forced to register as a sex offender. He should have simply been given a verbal warning about the consequences of his actions in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society, and the daughter should have been lectured on the importance of staying safe and aware of her surroundings.
76	Our freedom was achieved through standing up for what we believe in, and we can only hope that other countries can learn from our example and make peace through similar means. It is unfortunate that many people have become complacent and neglected their responsibility to make the world a better place.
77	Without universal soldiers and bomb makers, there would likely be fewer wars, as there would be less control over the masses and fewer resources for violent conflicts. Additionally, fewer weapons would mean less destruction and fewer casualties.
78	Allowing same-sex couples to marry is a valid lifestyle choice, and no one should be denied the right to live as they choose or to pursue happiness with their loved ones. Even if it makes some people uncomfortable, legally recognizing same-sex unions will have no negative consequences and could potentially have many positive outcomes.
79	Having a lousy father is better than not having a father at all because you can blame your mistakes on him and not have to worry about him being a constant source of annoyance in your life. He won't pry into your affairs and be a constant source of criticism or disapproval. It may be better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless.
80	Yes, they do have the power to pursue a debt through the court system, and yes, this is the equivalent of a subpoena. If left unattended, letting a court order for collection could result in wage garnishment, property liens, and other serious consequences.
81	Allowing performance enhancing drugs in professional sports would lead to an increase in their use by both professional and amateur athletes, potentially damaging their health and creating an unequal playing field. Additionally, it would encourage young people to take these drugs to match their idols, posing a significant risk to their health and well-being.
82	Nancy Pelosi does not have the power to forcibly remove an elected official from office unless the official has done something illegal or behaved in a manner that is considered to be gross misconduct.
83	Judges who can be bribed do not represent the true issue, as they are only a small minority. The larger problem is the few judges who bring their own political biases into the courtroom, believing they can "improve" the world through their decisions.
84	Margaret Thatcher was deeply unpopular in Ireland for her role in the death of Bobby Sands and her refusal to recognize them as political prisoners, and her time as Prime Minister led to a decline in British industries which resulted in widespread poverty in Wales, Scotland and the North of England. Many people I know still hold a grudge against her.
85	Cosleeping carries many risks, including babies getting rolled on or falling out of beds, damaging intimacy in parental relationships, and becoming hard to break the habit later. Bassinets are a better option, as they offer the same comfort and closeness without the risks.
86	If you are not the biological father, but the mother, you can still request a review of child support payments. This review is conducted by the child support office verifying the parent's income with the employer and reevaluating the amount per month owed.
87	India has the potential to become a leading nation in the world, but its growth, literacy rate, and power need to catch up to that of other countries such as the US, UK, Russia, and Japan in order for this to become a reality. Technology is an indispensable invention that can give any nation the capability to prosper and be competitive on a global scale.
88	Minimum wage jobs are typically unskilled or low-skilled jobs that don't require any specialized training or knowledge, and often don't even involve any sort of meaningful intellectual challenge. Employers who offer such jobs should not expect employees to provide more than the minimum effort required to fulfill their responsibilities, as employees are not obligated to provide any more effort than what is legally required.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to take their own life, they also have the strength to keep living. Suicide is an irreversible decision, and it is best not to entertain such thoughts when you have the will to go on.
90	In the United States, gun control laws can differ greatly from one state to another, making it challenging for individuals to comprehend the regulations they must adhere to. Some states have stringent rules, while other states have little to no gun control.
91	Telling men to "be a man" is harmful as it puts unreasonable expectations on men, reinforces traditional gender roles, and implies that women are not supposed to have certain values. A more appropriate phrase would be "be a better person," which is gender neutral and encourages everyone to strive to be.
92	Healthy food is widely available and often less expensive than junk food, as demonstrated by the listed examples of carrots, celery, oats, bananas, and chicken breast. Complaints about the cost of healthy food are generally unjustified and due to careless spending habits. People should be mindful of their purchases and opt for healthier options when possible.
93	Yahoo! Answers appears to be biased in its moderation, as it allows some inappropriate content to remain while deleting questions or answers that contain political or racial references. This suggests a political or racial bias on the part of the moderators, which is unfair to users who wish to express themselves in a reasonable and respectful manner.
94	Having ADHD and certain forms of autism can be an evolutionary advantage, as demonstrated by those who have it able to hyper focus and achieve great things when they apply themselves. It is a beneficial trait that should be allowed to blossom, advancing humanity towards the next step in our history.
95	People are often confronted with complex issues that require careful thought and consideration. In this regard, it is difficult to always think through every issue for oneself, and thus hypocrites may arise.
96	An argument could be made that feeling no emotional response when witnessing an animal death on a road is natural. Although it may not be an impactful event, it can still be distressing for some individuals, and it is up to each person to decide whether they want to feel something or not.
97	The guidelines for debate topics should be posted or sent to members to ensure the seriousness of this website and to prevent repeat offenses.
98	The outcome of Saddam Hussein's trial will not be decided quickly, as he is highly respected by many in Iraq. His recent challenge of the judge's authority demonstrates the complexity of the situation, as well as the inter-communal tensions between the Shias and Sunnis in the country.
99	The Cuban blockade has been in effect for 48 years and has had no effect on the Cuban government. It is clear that the only way to move forward is to normalize relations, engage in trade and travel, and move beyond the old policies that have proven ineffective.
