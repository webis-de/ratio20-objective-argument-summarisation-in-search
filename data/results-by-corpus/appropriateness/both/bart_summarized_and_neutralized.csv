0	The argument that porn can increase one's maturity and reduce the risk of future sexual assault is valid. While porn may expose individuals to the realities of sex, it can also be beneficial in allowing individuals to explore their sexuality in a safe and private way, allowing them to gain more control over their experience. In some cases, this can help to reduce any unwanted anxieties or pressure associated with engaging in sex, giving individuals the confidence to engage in it more safely.
1	My sister and her husband benefit greatly from their wealthy partners income, as they bring home a substantial amount of money each week. This adds up to an annual income of approximately $46,000, which helps to supplement their income. This can be beneficial for couples, as it can help to ease the financial burden of raising a family. However, this situation does not discriminate against couples where one partner is wealthy as it can benefit both types of couples.
2	In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. While this can make such activities more intense from a psychological perspective, it does not necessarily condone such behaviour. Every individual is entitled to their own preferences, and it is important to consider the consent of all involved in order to ensure that no one is being exploited or taken advantage of. Although these activities may be more intense, they should not be undertaken without careful consideration and respect for all involved.
3	I believe that while it is important to be aware of the potential risks, the potential benefits of combining animals to create new species could outweigh the costs. Therefore, I believe that it is worth pursuing as research allows, while taking into account any potential risks.
4	Gun control could help reduce the number of gun-related crimes by taking away access to firearms from potential criminals. While it may not be possible to completely prevent these crimes, introducing stricter gun control laws could make it more difficult for criminals to obtain firearms, helping to restore balance between potential victims and perpetrators.
5	If religious teachings are to blame for higher rates of rape in some regions, it is likely that the lack of a clear understanding of right and wrong due to differing cultural beliefs may contribute to the prevalence of the crime. This could be the case in some areas where religious teachings may not be as prominent, resulting in a potential lack of understanding of what is considered right and wrong. It is important to consider both factors when examining the issue.
6	Gay men and women face discrimination in different ways, as gay men may experience more discrimination due to their sexual orientation as they are not as accepted by straight people when it comes to expressing their romantic interest in men. However, lesbians are often accepted more as they can express their interest in women which can give them more acceptance.
7	The Chinese government presents some challenges when it comes to questioning its motives and policies due to its political structure. The United States typically takes a more diplomatic approach by maintaining good economic relations with China while still engaging in dialogue to address any issues that may arise.
8	I believe that it was inappropriate and could be seen as insensitive, as different cultures and religions should be respected. While Denmark may have been responding to the suicide bombers, these caricatures were still created without considering other beliefs and truths, which could be harmful to some people. While one incident may have been in response to another, it is still important to consider cultural sensitivities when creating
9	I understand that life can be unfair at times, and it can be difficult to understand why certain outcomes occur. While it is important to learn from these experiences, it can be difficult to gain an equal balance of success and failure. It can be beneficial to remember that even when the outcome is not fair, each individual has the opportunity to learn and grow from the experience.
10	The Scott Peterson case received a lot of media attention as it was similar to the O.J. Simpson case in that it involved a high-profile trial. However, the two cases differed in that Peterson killed his wife, unlike Simpson who was acquitted of murder. Due to this difference, the media coverage was higher for the Peterson case as it kept audiences engaged.
11	Hamas has fired over 2000 missiles into Israel in the past two weeks, posing a major threat to the safety of Israeli citizens. Israel has the right to take action in order to protect its citizens and ensure peace and security. Although Israel attempted cease-fires, Hamas' attacks persisted, highlighting the need for strong retaliation to keep Israel safe.
12	Government policies should grant equal rights and recognition to all couples regardless of their gender, while allowing religious institutions to determine who is eligible to marry according to their own beliefs. To achieve this, the government should offer legal recognition to both same-sex marriages and opposite-sex couples through either marriage or civil unions.
13	University can be an excellent experience which allows students to develop professionally and personally, however it can also mean sacrificing some of the elements which once made university special.   In some cases, universities can lack the inspiration which once made them so great, with some courses being more focused on churning out graduates to fit the job market's needs, rather than allowing students to truly explore their passions. This can mean that the university experience is not as
14	Bad Company 2 offers a more team-oriented experience than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, as it requires players to work together to complete objectives. The maps are more geared towards objective-based gameplay, so players are encouraged to move from point to point in order to achieve their goals. This adds a degree of excitement as players wait to see what surprise the map has in store.
15	It is important for the public to be aware of the death penalty in the U.S. in order to make informed decisions about the practice. Televising executions could help to bridge the gap in understanding between the public and the criminal justice system.
16	Democracies and Western values may not be the most appropriate solutions for countries struggling with conflict. Countries from different cultural backgrounds may benefit more from strategies that take into account their unique contexts. For example, in some countries the separation of church and state is not as clear-cut, and the rule of law is derived from the Koran rather than a secular republic. In these cases, this type of system may be more suitable.
17	Laws are designed to ensure a balance between the rights and freedoms of individuals and the greater good of society. In some cases, laws may conflict with a person’s rights or beliefs and it can be difficult to determine when this may occur. When laws are in conflict with an individual’s morals and values, it can be difficult to determine whether or not it is right to break the law.   It is important to consider both sides of the
18	The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs), indicates that the Hulk would likely be victorious in a battle royal.  Despite his impressive strength, Optimus Prime has limited hand strength which would be difficult to maintain over a long battle. Therefore, I believe the Hulk would be the victor in a battle royal.
19	It can be understood that both parties should work together to ensure a comfortable and hygienic bathroom experience. While it may be considerate for one person to put the toilet seat down after use, it is also important for the other person to put the seat up after use to ensure a consistent balance. This can help to reduce any slips or falls. Additionally, it is possible for both parties to agree on a comprom
20	The ban has been implemented in India, including Maharashtra, in an effort to clamp down on illegal activities that have been taking place at ladies bars. Complaints from housewives were reported to the government, highlighting the potential issues associated with these bars. Due to this, the government has decided to enforce the ban.
21	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, however same-sex marriages should also be recognized as valid unions. It is important to ensure that all couples, regardless of their gender, are provided with the same rights and benefits. This means granting them the same tax breaks and access to other government services.
22	The storm-cloaks are portrayed as the antagonistic force in the Civil War, as they seek to overthrow the current order and create a separate kingdom. While they may have different beliefs than the factions involved in the conflict, it does give the storyline a more complex dynamic as there is no clear-cut good or bad side. This could make the civil war quest line and story weaker, as it reduces the viewer’s engagement with the story by making it more difficult to sympathize with either side.
23	Having a number of Indian IIT alumni working at NASA is an indication of India's potential to make a significant contribution to global progress. If these individuals were to join the Indian Space Research Organisation, it would undoubtedly increase India’s standing in terms of science and technology. This could have beneficial implications for India’s visibility and reputation on an international scale.
24	Pornography can be a powerful and potentially-addictive medium, especially for vulnerable individuals who may have underlying mental health or relationship issues. It is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with viewing pornography, and to be mindful of one’s own limits and boundaries.
25	For example, “Young men, who make up 54 percent of the U.S. population, account for a higher proportion of insurance claims compared to young women. This can be attributed to the fact that young men tend to take more risks than young women, which can result in higher accidents and injury rates.   This difference in risk-taking behaviour can lead to higher insurance rates for young men, as insurance companies take into account the higher likelihood of claims among young males. While this may seem unfair, it is an industry-wide practice that is designed to account for gender-based differences in risk.”
26	Jesus was believed to be the Messiah by his followers, who saw him as the Son of God. Pilate was reportedly sorry for sentencing Jesus, as he understood the importance of Jesus' teachings, although he ultimately felt he had no choice as governor. It is likely that Jesus would have been dressed in a toga or other robes, along with sandals, as this was the only footwear available at the time.
27	There are several benefits of reservation in India, as it can help to reduce social inequality and economic disparities. While some individuals may benefit from this system, the overall goal is to provide assistance to those from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to give them a better chance of success. This can lead to greater equality in the long run as those who need it are provided with the support they need.
28	I would argue that not all foreigners are necessarily welcomed in Russia. It depends on the country and its culture. While some countries may be more open to welcoming foreigners, Russia is known to be more wary of those from other countries. This could be due to a range of factors, including past experiences or regional tensions. It is important to take into account the individual country’s context when evaluating the reception of foreigners.
29	It is important to consider the implications of upholding unlimited freedom of speech in regards to religious statements. Although it may be legally permissible to create and publish such statements, it could lead to potential issues as it may be seen as provocative or offensive by some. It is therefore important to consider the possible implications and whether the benefits of allowing unrestricted speech outweigh the potential risks.
30	Not all cultures are the same and while cultural influences may vary between different Latino countries, it is important to show respect for the customs of the country you are visiting. It is important to be aware of the cultural differences between countries, in order to show respect and ensure that you do not accidentally offend anyone.
31	I think it is important to prioritize efforts to address global climate change and other environmental issues on Earth first, as this is an urgent and pressing concern. It would be unwise to focus resources on space exploration when our planet needs more immediate attention.
32	I believe that it should ultimately be the decision of the property owner whether smoking is allowed or not. In terms of the potential impact on legislation, I prefer that my money goes towards saving for my child's college education rather than having the government dictate how smoking should be regulated. Ultimately, this legislation could restrict my choice in the matter and remove my ability to choose.
33	A woman who is being given the opportunity to make a difficult decision with the support of her loved ones? This is an important time for policy makers to consider the ethical implications of their decisions and ensure that the rights of all individuals are respected. While this may not be an election year, it is important to ensure that all citizens feel their voices are being heard and their rights are upheld. While the Schiavo case received much attention, it is important that all cases are addressed with the same level of care and sensitivity.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World, which is a great help in providing safety and security to the world. We currently have 366 military ships in commission which helps to cover a vast number of nautical miles. While this is sufficient for our current needs, it might be beneficial to have more ships deployed in these areas as it would provide added security and protection.
35	It is important to provide teens with accurate information about sexuality, while also stressing the importance of responsibility. Open communication between parents and children is essential for teens to understand the risks associated with sexual activity and to make informed decisions.
36	Why should an Israeli state be established in Germany following the Second World War? Although an historical claim is thousands of years old, the risks of setting up an independent state in this region are highly probable and could put the safety of the state at risk. Instead, a more feasible option could be to annex a portion of Germany, relocate the population, and work towards the acceptance of Jewish visitors in the Holy Land.  This would provide a safer environment for the state to exist while still allowing for the Jewish people to be able to have their own state.
37	I believe that legislation should be introduced with caution and only when necessary, as laws can have a major impact on people’s lives and may limit their freedoms. In some cases, the long-term implications of a law are hard to foresee and its effects on the individual and society could be far-reaching. It is important to consider all potential consequences and impacts before passing laws.
38	The argument for atheism is a valid one and I believe it to be true as there is a lack of evidence for a divine creator. I understand that some people find comfort in their faith, but it is important to have evidence to back up any beliefs. Ultimately, each person must decide which belief system feels most right to them based on the information available.
39	If abortion is 100% morally right, as I believe it is, then why do most women feel guilt after having an abortion? I believe that it is important for women to have access to a safe and supportive environment regardless of their choice, regardless of whether they choose to continue or terminate their pregnancy. Ultimately, every woman should feel that they have the right information, support and resources to make the best decision for their situation.
40	If your father's insurance premium increases due to the claim, you should be willing to pay your share as it will likely be reviewed within six months. While this can be an expensive situation for you, it is important to note that you will likely be covered in the long run. Although this may be an inconvenient situation, it is likely that the costs will be shared between all of the insured parties in the end.
41	Most of my parents' argument is that I should care about my family, as they are important to me and will be in my life for a long time. While I understand their point, I believe that it is important to choose who to be close to based on one's own personal preference. Just because I may not have my family around forever does not necessarily mean that I need to care about them.   It is true that family dynamics can be important and that it is beneficial to have strong relationships with certain family members. However, I believe
42	If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the basis of profiling that black drivers are more likely to be involved in accidents, this could lead to lawsuits. Law enforcement personnel carry and use guns, handcuffs and have the capacity to significantly impact individuals’ lives in a negative way. Therefore, both organizations should be held to the same standard.
43	I believe that it is acceptable for men to urinate while sitting down, as it can provide convenience in certain situations. While it is true that this may require a certain level of privacy, it can also be beneficial to not have to worry about balance or aim. In my experience, this practice is becoming more common and can be beneficial for both men and women. It should be noted, however, that this practice is not solely limited to men and may be more accepted among certain demographics.
44	Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. This is a valid option for the workplace, however it may be beneficial to inform employees of their rights so that they can make an informed decision about whether or not it is the right choice for their workplace. It is important to be aware of the implications of joining a union so that both employers and employees are aware of their options.
45	While the term "redskin" may have been used in a similar manner to the N-word in the past, it is important to consider the context in which it is used now. It is possible that its usage can be similar to that of the N-word, but it may also be used in a completely different context. Each usage should be taken into consideration when determining its potential levels of racism.
46	I believe that helping someone in your family is the most important type of endeavor, as it can be essential in times of need and provides stability. However, it is also important to look out for the common good and offer assistance when possible. Both can be done by balancing the needs of both the individual and the collective.
47	Income taxes are controversial as some people argue that they infringe upon personal freedom as they take money from individuals despite the fact that it is unconstitutional. While there is no explicit provision in the Constitution allowing for income taxation, it is still implemented in many countries.   In some countries, income taxes are collected by the government through tax forms and deductions from wages. In other countries, individuals are
48	The 4th Amendment is intended to protect individuals from undue government intrusion, however in practice it can be difficult for government agencies to access private information without a court order. In some instances, the media may have access to personal information due to legal loopholes which can create a conflict between privacy rights and freedom of the press. This can create a challenge as it is important to balance both interests while still respecting an individual's right to privacy.
49	Many people are skeptical of the government's involvement in 9/11, and prefer to believe that a third-party was responsible. This theory has been gaining traction and may prove to be true. Such a traumatic event would likely cause long-term effects for those affected and their families, which cannot be denied. Ultimately, the truth may never be fully known, and it is important to be aware of both sides of the argument.
50	The repeated displays of installation art at museums, such as the Tate Modern, can be disappointing as many of the pieces can be very similar in style and content. While some works can be impactful, it is true that these pieces can become redundant after seeing multiple iterations. It is important for artists to be able to challenge and innovate to ensure that art remains interesting and engaging.
51	"Yes, I believe that President Bush should be impeached," says CNN's John Sutter. "While Bush may not be the most egregious offender, he is certainly among the worst and therefore warrants removal from office."   Impeaching a president is a significant step and should not be taken lightly. However, in cases where a president is
52	Poland Spring utilizes a rigorous filtration system, which is tested regularly throughout the production process to ensure the safety of the water. This process ensures the water quality remains consistent and meets strict quality standards.
53	California laws generally favor allowing fathers their legal visitation rights. If this is not possible due to the mother's refusal, it is important to seek legal guidance to ensure fair outcomes for all parties involved. It is important to have a court order in place to ensure the children's legal rights are respected. An attorney can help with this process.
54	I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I often feel tired and drained due to the work I have to do. I recognize that a college education requires a lot of hard work and dedication. I strive to stay motivated and focused on my goals, as it is important to me to succeed. I believe that hard work is key and that is true for anyone seeking a better life.
55	I believe that climate change is occurring and that humans have a role in its acceleration. While the causes of climate change are complex and not fully understood, scientific consensus suggests that human activities, such as emissions and land use changes, are contributing to global warming. I believe that this is a pressing issue that requires urgent action to reduce our impact and mitigate the effects of climate change.
56	It is difficult to determine if a being that is capable of achieving sentience would necessarily be equal to humans, as this depends on the rate at which it is able to achieve this. If it is able to do so at a faster rate, then it would be able to surpass humans. Therefore, it is difficult to make this comparison without more information.
57	It is important to report any injuries to your supervisor and to seek medical attention, as this will provide evidence to support your case. Without this evidence, it may be difficult to prove your case, so it is important to be thorough in reporting the injury. Additionally, it is wise to consult a lawyer to understand the full process and possible outcomes. Ultimately, the outcome of the case depends on many factors, so it is best to be prepared.
58	What good does it do to punish some marijuana offenders while letting others off lightly? Both types of offenders should be held accountable, as it could help to reduce the overall usage of marijuana.   Although marijuana laws have historically been strict, this does not necessarily mean that they are right. Reforms to these laws could help to create a more equitable system and provide better outcomes for all involved.
59	The United States represents approximately one-third of the global prison population despite having only around 5% of the world’s population. This indicates that the US does indeed use incarceration more often than other countries, likely due to the fact that the US criminal justice system is more punitive than others in terms of sentencing and sanctions. This is further evidenced by the fact that while crime rates have been steadily decreasing globally, the US has seen an increase in its incarceration rate. Therefore, understanding the underlying context behind these numbers is important
60	There are individuals who have committed crimes who still possess the capacity to make a positive contribution to society and thus, should be granted the right to vote while incarcerated. This can provide rehabilitated offenders with a sense of responsibility and civic duty that can help foster a greater sense of belonging and community upon their eventual release.
61	Rudy's is located in Chandler, Texas and has been a popular restaurant choice among locals and visitors alike for many years. I relocated to Austin from 2000 to 2007 and had the pleasure of enjoying Rudy's barbeque on numerous occasions. I particularly enjoyed their brisket which was cooked to perfection and the unique flavor of their sauce. The gas station setting adds to the charm of the experience, making Rudy's a memorable part of my time in Texas.
62	Marriage should be available to all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation. Everyone should have the right to express their love and commitment to one another and share their lives with the person they love. The Bible teaches us that God is accepting of all people, and it should be respected that all individuals should be able to express their relationships freely. It is unfair to deny
63	Both sides of the debate on abortion have valid arguments. While it is true that abortion ends the life of a fetus, it is important to consider both the physical and emotional wellbeing of the mother in the decision-making process. It is important to take into account the personal feelings of the individual to determine what is best for them in the situation.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, released, and then returned these fish to the water. It is clear that fishing can be an unpleasant experience for the animals, as they can suffer both when caught and when released. While it may be morally acceptable to release the fish in order to preserve the environment, it is still an uncomfortable and undesirable process for the fish. I understand the necessity of it in some cases, but it is something I am still uncomfortable with.
65	I've been in this region my entire life, and even though we have taken a hit economically, it is disheartening. Many areas throughout Florida have suffered from this downturn, including Tampa, Orlando, and Miami. However, areas such as Southwest Florida (Fort Myers, Naples, Cape Coral) have seen a decrease in economic activity due to the loss of seasonal visitors as well as retirees. This can be difficult for areas that rely heavily on tourism, as it is a volatile industry that can fluct
66	We’ve seen some cases where members of Congress may have had limited understanding of the legislation they voted on, leading to a need for greater oversight of the legislative process. This highlights the importance of having informed legislators in order to ensure that laws are properly drafted and effective in achieving their intended goals. It is important that legislators are held accountable and that voters are able to make informed decisions on who to elect.
67	"I often find that Reddit comments can be difficult to understand as they can vary widely in quality. It is important to ensure that one’s opinions are formed through one’s own analysis and thoughts, rather than relying solely on pop culture references. This enables deeper and more meaningful conversations to occur and allows for more complex topics to be discussed."
68	The U.S. has a strategic partnership with China, which allows for greater economic and political cooperation than with other countries. This relationship is beneficial to both nations, as it allows for greater collaboration on a range of issues and ensures greater stability in the region. Although Cuba and China both have anti-democratic governments, the U.S. has a stronger relationship with China due to their shared interests in Central Asia.
69	If the 18-year-old was living with their father, then the parents would likely share the financial responsibility for the youth's living arrangements. However, the parent may not necessarily be obligated to pay for the costs if the young adult was still in high school, as the situation may depend on the circumstances and the agreement between the parents and the youth. As such, it may be best to consult with an appropriate professional to gain more clarity on the situation.
70	I understand as a union guy that our dues are typically lower than corporate donations, but unions and other organizations are able to pool funds through PACs and Super PACs during election season, which can create a greater impact. Nevertheless, I believe that corporations should not be allowed to donate to politicians as they often have too much influence already.
71	Farquhar is not necessarily the sole founder of Singapore as the concept of a founder is often associated with the idea of discovering a place. While it is true that Farquhar was the first permanent settler of Singapore, there are other factors which contribute to the development of a place and its history, such as the establishment of a settlement and its growth over time. Thus, while Farquhar may have been the first to settle Singapore, there are others who have contributed to its development and legacy as a
72	17-year-old is a straight A student who might occaisonally receive a B+. While this can vary from person to person, there is no denying that some online users may lack the education or experience that others possess. It is important to remember that every user should be given the benefit of the doubt, regardless of their age or experience level. Everyone should be respected and given the same level of courtesy regardless of their
73	I think this behavior by professional soccer players is not acceptable. While an injury can occur suddenly and without warning, players should still be aware of the potential for injury and should not exaggerate their injuries to gain an advantage. This type of behavior is unsportsmanlike and should be penalized with a yellow card.
74	I believe that, while psychedelic drugs can cause some short-term side effects, the overall risk of these drugs is low, and they should be made available with proper regulations in place. While some studies have indicated that these drugs can be harmful, this research has not been conclusive and further research is necessary to fully understand the potential risks of these drugs. Until more is known, I believe that these drugs should remain legal as they can provide a positive impact on the user's quality of life.
75	It can be difficult to understand the reasons behind a court’s decision, especially when it does not align with our own opinion. In this case, the court may have felt that the parent's actions could lead to further boundary violations in the future, and it was best to advise them on the appropriate ways to interact with their child. While it is understandable to want to protect a child, it is important to consider the long-term impact of our decisions.
76	People need to take responsibility for their actions and not blame external factors such as science or society. Countries can become unstable due to a lack of peace and the inability of different countries to come together in unity. We as individuals must strive to create lasting peace in these countries by encouraging unity and cooperation between different nations.
77	I believe that without the universal soldier and bomb maker, there would be less control over the masses - which can only be seen as a positive thing. There would be fewer governments and more direct democracies, allowing citizens to make decisions more quickly and efficiently. This could lead to more unity and cohesion among groups, reducing the likelihood of future wars.
78	Gay marriage is an important issue that should be respected and accepted by society. Although it may be seen as non-traditional, couples should have the right to make their own decisions with regards to their personal relationships. No one chooses to be gay, and it is important to recognize the unique challenges and needs of LGBT+ couples.  It is essential that all couples have the same access to marriage as straight couples, as this provides equal
79	It can be beneficial to have a father present in one's life, even if he is not ideal, as it provides security and stability. Having a father can provide a sense of comfort and support, as well as give one an emotional safety net. This can help in forming relationships and attaining success, as one may not have to worry as much about having their privacy invaded or having to defend their actions. It can be beneficial to have a father present in one's life, as they can serve as a strong influence and source of guidance.
80	If you choose to ignore the notice of motion from the collection firm, it is possible that you may incur additional fees and charges. It is best to seek legal counsel from a professional in order to create a manageable payment plan that suits your financial situation.
81	The use of performance enhancing drugs in professional sports could have a detrimental effect on athletes if they were allowed, as younger athletes may be tempted to use them without fully understanding the potential risks. This could lead to increased use of steroids and other drugs and could potentially damage their long-term health, therefore it is best to keep them illegal in order to protect athletes.
82	The appearance of impropriety can be concerning, but it is important to establish whether or not the activity was actually illegal. In some cases, this can involve felony level offenses, which could lead to the judge being removed from office. In the case of the freezer cash, while it is suspicious, it may not have been illegal depending on the details of the situation. Therefore, it is important to evaluate each case on its own merits to determine the legality of the activity
83	The philosophy for being a judge is to be impartial and make decisions based on the law and the facts of each case. However, there is a potential for some judges to be influenced by external sources, such as campaign contributions, which could lead to unequal access to justice.  While it is unlikely that a single judge will make a decision based on political affiliation, it is possible that justice could be biased due to money and influence.
84	In the early 80s, while in power, Margaret Thatcher made difficult decisions regarding the treatment of Bobby Sands and other IRA members, though this was likely influenced by the political climate at the time. Her tenure as Prime Minister did result in economic changes which had an effect on Wales, Scotland, and the North of England, though these changes were not exclusively limited to those areas and had a wider impact across the UK.
85	Having a baby in bed can be beneficial as it allows parents to easily care for their baby while sleeping without having to switch between rooms. While this may be an adjustment for some, it can provide a practical solution for parents without completely disrupting the sleeping arrangements. Additionally, basinet sheets and covers can be easily moved, making it possible for them to fit in most
86	Some states provide cost of living increases annually, which can help to ensure that child support payments remain adequate. In cases where the parents have separate residences, child support agencies will also look into the income of both parents in order to ensure that the payments are equitable. This can be beneficial in cases where the non-custodial parent is initially earning a lower wage due to their age and education when the child was conceived.
87	While India still lags behind some countries in terms of technological development, it has the potential to lead the world in the future. India has made significant progress in terms of literacy and economic growth, which gives it the potential to become a global leader. Countries such as the US, UK, Russia, and Japan have had more time and resources to develop their technologies, giving them an advantage over India at this point in time. However, India's growth provides reason
88	Minimum wage can provide employers with a baseline for compensation as it may be necessary to attract and retain employees, particularly in cases where a job requires both skill and intellect. While minimum wage may not offer employers a great deal of financial gain, it may help ensure that employees are earning at least a minimum level of compensation for their efforts.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider taking their own life, they also have the strength to continue living. It is important to consider all options carefully and recognize that suicide is a difficult decision that should not be taken lightly. While it may seem like a viable option in the moment, it is generally best to seek help or talk to someone who can provide support.
90	In North Carolina, there is a waiting period of three days for the purchase of a handgun, after taking a state-mandated firearms safety course. This is in addition to the background checks and safety protocols that must be fulfilled before any gun purchase can be made. This waiting period is designed to provide an additional layer of protection and ensure that guns are purchased legally and responsibly.
91	This phrase can be harmful as it can lead to feelings of exclusion for men who don't conform to traditional gender roles, as these expectations can be seen as exclusive to men. This can be damaging as it may make those men feel like they do not belong.
92	In the UK, a variety of healthy food items can be found for much lower prices than unhealthy options. For example, you can purchase several kilograms of food for less than £4, which can last months when properly stored in a freezer. Therefore, this myth that healthy food is more expensive than junk is not necessarily true.
93	CNN's John Sutter has stated that Yahoo Answers can be politically and racially biased, as it has been seen to favour Republican viewpoints in its answers. This can lead to a misrepresentation of information, as users may be more likely to see answers which align with their personal beliefs. This can lead to an unbalanced view of the issues being discussed, which can prevent people from getting a full picture of the topic.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism can be beneficial, as they can provide an individual with unique strengths and skills. Rather than being viewed as a disease, these conditions can be seen as part of the human evolution process, allowing individuals to reach their full potential. I have witnessed this first-hand with friends who have ADHD and who are able to focus in order to achieve great things. Additionally, some individuals with autism can thrive in jobs where their special needs are better understood and supported.
95	Conservative and pro-life views often align with one another as they both value protecting the life of an unborn child. Although some people may believe that the foetus should not be carried to term, this is not the same position as being pro-choice, which allows for the potential life to be terminated. Similarly, although the U.S. may have seen a benefit to the short-term removal of a nation state, this is not the same as being pro-war, which would take into account the long-term effects of a military
96	Witnessing an animal death is difficult, and it is understandable to respond emotionally in such a situation. Although it may be difficult to form an emotional bond with animals, it is important to show respect and care for the creatures who share our world. It is important to remember that while we may view animals as individuals, our relationship is like that of a driver encountering a roadkill; we must still be sensitive to their deaths as it is a sad part of life in the wild.
97	I believe it is important for debate topics to be declared upfront to ensure that all participants are aware of the topic and can make an informed decision on whether or not they want to participate. If the guidelines are not posted or sent to members, it can lead to confusion and disruption of the debate. As such, I believe it is important for the guidelines to be provided ahead of time.
98	Given the emotion surrounding the trial, it is likely that both sides will seek what they believe is the best outcome for Saddam. While the U.S. may want a death sentence, it is important to take into account the opinions of Iraqis, who may see things differently and want a different outcome. Ultimately, it will be up to the tribunal to make this decision, and it is important to consider both the international and local perspectives when making such a decision.
99	The Cold War is over, and there is now a new global political landscape. It is time to move on and normalise relations with Cuba, allowing for travel, trade and financial transactions to resume. This will bring many benefits to both countries and can be done while still protecting US interests.
