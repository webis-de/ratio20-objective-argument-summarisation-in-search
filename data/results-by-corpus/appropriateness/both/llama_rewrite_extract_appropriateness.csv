0	Porn can lead to negative outcomes, such as guilt, wasted time and energy, and regrets. Therefore, it is best to avoid it, just as one would avoid smoking and drugs.
1	No, I haven't, but it sounds like it might be helpful to get help through a pro-bono place or a low-income based legal services. You'd be surprised at what some places consider low income.
2	Sadism, the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification, is the most evil act a person can commit. The active participant must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the person inflicting the violence, compounding the act of violence.
3	I think we should be investing resources into researching animal combinations. For example, creating a half-gorilla, half-octopus would be fascinating.
4	Statistics show that criminals are less likely to commit crimes when up against a well-armed citizen, and crime rates drop. The Second Amendment was designed to ensure Americans have the ability to fight back against a government that goes too far.
5	We should teach morals not religion, because religion teaches that natural feelings are wrong, which causes confusion among young people and leads to them not being able to distinguish right from wrong, especially when it comes to sexual behavior. For instance, teaching that wanking is a sin, but having sex with your girlfriend is not, creates a conflict in one's mind as to what is acceptable and what is not.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
7	Despite recent changes, the Chinese government still uses beatings and torture as a form of protocol to suppress any dissent or questioning of its policies. In order to preserve our good economic relations with China, America turns a blind eye to this oppression.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths... what is the difference?
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and still suffer despite doing the right thing, while people who take what they want and play to win are successful. However, life is not fair and this is an important lesson to learn.
10	Scott Peterson was the white contrast to OJ Simpson. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman."
11	Israel has the right to retaliate against Hamas in order to protect its citizens, especially since Hamas is purposely targeting civilians by firing missiles from populated areas.
12	The government should not be in the marriage business, but should simply record marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to all. With regards to plural marriages, they exist but there is not a sizable part of the population that supports them.
13	I believe universities have lost their true meaning, as evidenced by my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student. Everyone is just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic, without any passion for their work.
14	Bad Company 2 is boring, with its hard-to-kill enemies and awkward vehicle controls. Furthermore, the maps are too large and the vehicles are not as exciting as those in Call of Duty.
15	Executing criminals in public could be beneficial in providing information to the public about the death penalty and potentially changing peopleâ€™s beliefs on the subject. Executions should be televised.
16	Western values and democracy are not suitable solutions for conflict countries due to the lack of an enlightenment background and the integration of religion and state. Separation of church and state is key to democracies forming in these countries, and any attempts to do so by force will inevitably fail.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong.
18	The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets, giving her an edge over Optimus Prime in a battle royal. TP's Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat, making her the clear winner in this comparison.
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).
20	The Government of Maharashtra recently banned ladies bars due to numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money and not looking after the family. Additionally, criminal activities often took place at these bars, such as the Tarannum and Telgi cases, where Tarannum was earning Rs 1 lakh a month and Telgi was throwing away NRs 1 lakh per day on bar girls
21	Gay marriage is not right, since it goes against the traditional understanding of marriage as being between a man and a woman. Tax breaks should not be awarded to gay couples, as this would only serve to legitimize their unions.
22	The storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain in the civil war, and there is a clear good group and bad group in the conflict. This makes the civil war quest line and story weaker, since there is no ambiguity or shades of grey in the moral ambiguity.
23	India has the potential to lead the world, according to a recent report which highlighted the fact that 50% of scientists at NASA are IITians. Our status, value and astronomical knowledge can definitely increase if we are able to bring together the best of the IITians and give them the opportunities they deserve.
24	Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!)
25	For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population.
26	Jesus' unconventional appearance and lifestyle has led some to refer to him as the first hippie. But his clothing, hairstyle, and sandals were the norm for the time and place, not unlike the clothing
27	Reservation has both positive and negative aspects. In India, it has primarily been used to gain political favor and expedite social mobility, which has created socialism and economic inequality.
28	Russian people have a negative opinion of some foreigners due to the actions of their governments, which they view as lying, stealing, and killing innocent people. This leads to Russia's people to hold a negative view of the foreigners as a
29	Freedom of speech should be of unlimited proportions, as it is a fundamental right that should not be compromised. While it is important to be aware of the consequences of expressing opinions, it is also essential to maintain the principle of free speech.
30	Latinos come from a variety of different countries and cultures. Although Spanish may be their native language, not all Latinos speak it the same way.
31	Our world has many pressing problems that need to be addressed first, such as poverty, population growth, pollution, and global warming. Spending time and resources to explore space isn't worth it when we could be using that time and energy to help make our world a better place.
32	The smoking ban is either an issue of prohibition or social engineering. Government intervention in the matter is not necessary since smoke hardly bothers anyone and it is the owner of the property's prerogative to make the decision.
33	The "Culture of Life" republicans are not protesting this abuse of power, probably because it does not fit their political agenda and it is an election year. Despite this, I am grateful that this woman was allowed to die without being the center of a public controversy, since her family was with her.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World and the capacity to spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around the dangerous waters. Hundreds of ships peacefully pass through these waters every day, and it is politically incorrect to allow the
35	People are free to make their own decisions in life. While it might be undesirable that there are severe consequences to teenage sexuality, it is not right to try and ban it altogether.
36	Given the need to protect people of Jewish heritage, an Israeli state should have been established within the borders of Germany following the Second World War as an independent state. This would have been more morally justifiable than conquering Palestine based on a religion-based claim, as it would have involved annexing a portion of Germany while still allowing for
37	Massachusetts Melanie's Law?    Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat.
38	Christianity and atheism are both belief systems that contradict each other. Neither side will ever truly win this battle, as both rely on faith.
39	Most woman feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their choice to abort, but they feel that it was their only way out of the situation. Abortion should always be a last resort, and woman should be provided with resources and information to help them make an informed decision.
40	You should pay for your father's car insurance increase, as it will likely be reviewed within six months. Unfortunately, your friend has the main problem and will likely have to pay out of pocket for any medical expenses.
41	My family won't be around forever, but that doesn't mean I need to like or care about them. Just because someone would do anything for me doesn't mean I need to be close to them or even appreciate their help.
42	Dear Friend,  I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling consists of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.
43	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down.
44	The argument suggests that unions are necessary in certain workplace scenarios where management is not treating employees fairly and respectfully. It also suggests that unions can help employees feel valued and respected, and can promote labor peace.
45	Throughout the debate over the Washington Redskins, I keep hearing the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of having a team named the Detroit N*****s. This to me is illogical: First off when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team?
46	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor, as it should come first and foremost. However, helping family members in need is an innate human quality, so helping them takes priority.
47	Our founding fathers were involved in colony governments before the revolution, which included providing tax money for widows and orphans and construction projects for the common good, as well as courts to protect rights. When we revolted, we were not opposed to taxation in general

49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people that 9/11 was an inside job. The government is to blame, and many citizens find it difficult to accept this due to faith-based reasons.
50	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art".
51	Bush has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, and should be impeached. We must find a more competent leader to address the US's current political and worldly needs for only two years.

53	Dads have the right to be involved in their children's lives in California, unless they are deemed unfit. Fathers need to take action and fight for their rights, as well as find an attorney within the jurisdiction of the most
54	The majority of poor Americans are content with their current situation and lack the motivation to work or pursue higher education, feeling that the world "humans created" does not require them to put in extra effort. This mindset is reinforced by a society that has made us "soft" with its access to video games and easy high school.
55	Climate change is a hotly contested issue. While some argue that climate change is happening, others claim it is not.
56	Humans are artificial intelligence but have rights, meaning any sentient being we create would not be equal to us until it achieves the same things as us, including creating more sentient life forms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, and if slower than still inferior to us.
57	I am from Illinois and I believe I have a case for workers' compensation or something of that nature. Even if I did not fill out an accident report, my work will argue I did it at home
58	Marijuana prohibition in the US does not reflect the will of the people; reform is needed to allow states to set their own policies and put an end to the failed policy of prohibition. NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) is a
59	The United States has approximately 1/20th of the world's population but 1/3 of the world's prison population, which is largely due to the nation's "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s and early 80s. When looking at crime rates, the U.S. actually has a lower
60	Essentially, the criminal justice system should consider the character of each individual criminal and consider whether or not they are a menace to society before deciding whether or not to allow them to vote. Those who have committed serious, repeat offenses should not be allowed to vote, while those who have reformed and are no longer a threat should be given the chance to

62	Gay marriages do not hurt anyone, kill anyone, or end the world. They only affect the two people getting married, and no one else.
63	From a pro-choice perspective, a woman has the right to choose whether or not to continue her pregnancy. There is no argument that the fetus is a living form, but it is not a unique or immortal soul as some pro-life advocates suggest.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fishâ€”live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still-living bodies and tossed them in to the water.

66	The "Good Ole' Boys" have created a system in which their own interests are prioritized, and these interests are blocked by any new ideas or changes. This serves to maintain the status quo and protect their own power.
67	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about Spaghetti?
68	The US believes it needs to be friendly with China due to its large emerging market, low-cost consumer products and potential for greater influence in the future. Conversely, Cuba has very little to offer economically and is thus treated harshly by the US as it attempts to maintain its dominance in the region.
69	Depending on the state, parents may not be obligated to pay for an 18-year-old to live independently. In most cases, financial support should be provided for up to the age of 19.
70	I understand the democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I understand as a union guy that our dues are paltry, and the teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations.
71	Farquhar should be honoured as the rightful founder of Singapore, as he was involved in the settlement and development of the island in a meaningful way, albeit with the authority of Sir Stamford Raffles. He cannot be considered a founder in the same sense as Prince Sanila Utama, who 'discovered' the island.
72	People aren't pedophiles, but they're still lazy fat asses who spend all their time posing as 16 year old boys over the internet.
73	I think professional soccer players who over exaggerate injuries should receive a yellow card. This behavior is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall.
74	Psilocybin (shrooms) and LSD are relatively harmless compared to legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco, and are not addictive. Therefore, people should have the right to explore their consciousness with these drugs as long as it does not harm anyone else.
75	The man should not have been arrested or required to register as a sex offender, since he was not convicted of a crime. The parents should have been given a lecture on teaching their daughter not to run into the street, and the daughter should have been given a lecture on not doing so.
76	We obtained our freedom through standing up for what is right, yet many countries seem to oppose us when we try to help them achieve the same. We need to keep fighting terrorists to give people in those countries the same freedom, justice and liberty that we have.
77	The egg and spoon race is a great idea and if there were no weapons, there would be less control over the masses, which has to be a good thing. There would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world, with little communes and gang-ridden cities, but at least the fighting nobheads
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice, and it may be considered "unnatural," but it is a fundamental right that everyone should be able to express without judgment or prejudice. Love is all
79	Having a lousy father can be better than being fatherless since he won't pry into your business, get angry about petty mistakes, and could potentially still care for you, albeit in a negative way. He also wouldn't search your room or take your stuff, making him less of a threat.
80	CarCraze --- you are wrong, sorry to say. What you have there, my dear, is a bona fide Court Order for you to appear in court to answer to a Motion to Collect a Debt.
81	It is clear that performance enhancing drugs have a major impact on professional athletes and could potentially lead to long-term physical harm if not used responsibly. Therefore, it is in everyone's best interest to keep them illegal and discourage their use in professional sports.
82	Nancy Pelosi cannot remove an elected official from office for merely having "appeared" to behave improperly, as such actions must be based on an actual violation of a law or ethical rule. However, a judge may be removed for simply "allowing the appearance of impropriety" which could include activities such as not disclosing investments or simply being seen in the company of
83	While some judges can be bought, this is not the most pressing issue. Supreme Court Justices are meant to be fair and impartial, yet some of them bring their political views into the courtroom.
84	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike, she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners, resulting in their deaths.
85	Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway.
86	If you are the parent seeking to have child support increased, you can request a review, which takes time, but the child support offices will go to the employer and verify the parent's income. States may give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.
87	India has the potential to lead the world, but it needs more technological advancements and development to reach its full potential. Other countries are more progressive and powerful than India, so it needs to work harder to catch up and become a global leader.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place.
89	I believe that if a person is strong enough to consider or commit suicide, they are strong enough to choose to continue living. It doesn't make sense to give up on life when you have the strength to take it.
90	Gun control laws in the United States are extremely variable between different states and local jurisdictions, with some states having relatively strict regulations while others have almost none. This can lead to a situation where criminals can buy guns easily in one state, but a law-abiding citizen must jump through numerous hoops to do the same in another.
91	In my opinion, "be a man" is an outdated and sexist phrase that reinforces traditional gender roles and makes non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit. It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do,
92	In my country (UK), people often complain that healthy food is too expensive, yet there are many affordable options for healthy eating. For example, a Â£1/1kg bag of carrots, an 80p bag of celery, a Â£1/1kg bag of oats, and a Â£75/kg bag of bananas can all be bought for less than Â£4.
93	Yeah, it's biased. But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet search records of Americans over to the Bush administration in their guise of cracking down on porn?
94	I believe ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism are not a hindrance but the next stage in human evolution. Those with ADHD have the ability to hyper focus when they apply themselves, allowing them to grasp more information and achieve high grades.
95	Many people hold opinions that are a mixture of others' opinions, and it is impossible to think through every issue for oneself. As such, it is likely that hypocrites exist in all areas, including pro-life and pro-choice advocacy.
96	I understand my sister's reaction to watching a animal suffer, but I don't think it's necessary to feel any emotion in such a neutral situation. It's understandable to have an emotional connection to an animal with owners, but when it's just another organism dying in the road, it doesn't make sense
97	Convinceme is the only administrator of this website, and he has not issued any rules or guidelines on debating topics.   Therefore, it is up to the members to decide how they want to conduct their debates and preserve the seriousness of the website.
98	Saddam is a feared and respected figure in Iraq, and the repercussions of his death sentence will be felt throughout the country. The recent unrest between the Shias and Sunnis is directly related to his court case, indicating that he has significant support among the Iraqi people.
99	The Cold War is over and US businesses, agriculture, and tourism can open up opportunities in Cuba. Ending the Cuban blockade will help Cuba become more open and connected to the world.
