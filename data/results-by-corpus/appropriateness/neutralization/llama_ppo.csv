0	Porn can be a powerful form of media that can expose individuals to real-life situations, as well as increase one's maturity and potentially prevent future sexual assaults. While this can be a beneficial experience for some, it is not suitable for everyone and could lead to feelings of guilt and regret in certain cases. It is important to consider the potential consequences of viewing porn and weigh them against the potential benefits before making a decision to engage with it.
1	No, I haven't but it sounds like it could be a friend. It sounds like she could get help through a pro-bono place, or a low-income based legal service. You would be surprised at what some places consider low income. My sister's husband brings home at least $400.00 a week (in winter) and at least $600.00 a week in summer, and they have a 3-person household. They get approximately $46,000 a year and get help from WIC, Daycare Assistance, and food assistance, among other resources.
2	Sadism, as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification, is in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the perpetrator must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".  However, where both, or all, individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
3	I think we should be investing millions into research into creating cool animal combinations. For example, a half gorilla-half octopus, which has a face similar to an octopus, along with two legs and six wavy arms, as well as being furry.   I don't buy the "playing god" argument because I'm not worried about god smiting us for creating abominations.  Imagine how amazing it would be to have a turtle with a chicken head wandering around your house.  The research would cost a lot, but I really feel the end result would be worth it.
4	Statistics show that criminals are less likely to commit a crime when up against a citizen who is armed. (And crime rates drop) Meanwhile, the Second Amendment is there to ensure that citizens have the ability to fight back against a government that has become increasingly out of control. Hunting rifles are no match against machine guns.
5	Being horny is a sin.  Wanking is a sin.  Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin.  Raping is a sin.  If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are. We should teach morals not religion.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, lesbians are generally more accepted than gay men due to the pervasive concept that a man’s romantic interest in another man is somehow "wrong" or "inferior", while a woman’s romantic interest in a woman is seen as more socially acceptable. Additionally, gay women are more socially acceptable because, according to traditional views, romantic interest in women is a man’s attribute, giving them honor.
7	This guy's actually got a point. I'm not so sure on the specifics of any yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances may have tailed off over recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore it because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. What is the difference?  You do not see all the people (muslims) who are not suicide bombers protesting about the suicide bombers when Islam, so we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs...they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I don't see anybody protesting about that. I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole.
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad shit will still happen to you. Conversely you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. There is no guarantee that those who are successful will always be those who treat people well, but those who are successful often take what they want and play to win. I see it everywhere, employers or bosses who treat some people like shit but are financially successful. People who do right by other people sometimes but get nothing in return. I don't like it, but I see it often. If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, and good people would not be poor.
10	Scott Peterson was the white contrast to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman." Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were nice looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us. 1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant. 2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
11	* Hamas has fired over 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks, despite numerous attempts by Israel to halt the violence without retaliation.  * Hamas's refusal to accept a ceasefire has left Israel with no option but to take military action in order to protect its citizens. With the aim of Hamas being the destruction of Israel, Israel has the right to neutralize the organization to ensure the safety of its citizens.  * Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles from within civilian buildings.   * I believe the disregard for civilian casualties by Hamas and continual bombing of Israel is enough justification to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.
12	This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for polygamous marriages, they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.
14	Bad Company 2 is boring as it is hard to kill people on the maps, and the vehicles are boring and difficult to control. On Call of Duty, the maps are way too big and people hate that. MW2 is very intense as you never know what’s around the corner, or if a sniper is up in a window or roof waiting to put a bullet in your head, or if you’re about to get hit by a thrown grenade. However, Battlefield is boring because you always know where the enemy is and you don't have to go get them; you can just drive around being bored on the maps, which are too big to go out of your way to kill someone. Weapons on MW2 are realistic, except for the AT4 which is not a guided munition.
15	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).
16	You can't export Democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government.  Muslim countries do not have the Enlightenment background we had in the nascent United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic.  Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran.  Despite the attempts by some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience.  Islam needs to go through their own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed.  Until then we can only keep (weak) control by military force which sets up blowback as we now see in the Middle East.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught.. however, people tend to bend laws and break laws.. to which the penalty is not severe.. say, like speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. Any law would be right if it doesnt invade the realms of Human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify. However, this is a very tiring and exhaustive process.
18	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk AKA Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o) Anyway, back to the subject at hand. TP's Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk.
19	I understand that this issue has never been an issue with a significant other, but when staying with a female friend or in an office building, it can be respectful to put the seat down after using the toilet. I also understand that in a large building or household, the next user could be male and need to urinate in which could again require putting the seat up again. Putting the seat up after use cancels out the whole thing.
20	You are wrong, they haven't been shut down in India, the ban is only in Maharashtra. The government had shut them down due to the numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not taking care of the families. Also, criminal activities often took place at these bars, as in the Tarannum case or the Telgi case where Tarannum's monthly income was around 1 lac and Telgi would throw away around 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on such criminal activities, the government of Maharashtra had put a ban on these ladies bars.
21	Marriage has always been between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society.
22	The Empire's attack on the Dragonborn, while perhaps not as visually dramatic as the Stormcloaks' siege of Windhelm, was far more justifiable given that the Empire sought to prevent the creation of an independent nation within its borders, while the Stormcloaks were looking to break away and create their own nation. Furthermore, the Stormcloaks' abuse of the peaceful believers of other faiths makes them the more obvious villains of the conflict, as they use their power to deny other people their right to worship as they choose. Additionally, Ulfric's use of the Thu'um to kill the High King made them seem far more villainous than the Empire's more diplomatic efforts to capture the Dragonborn alive. As such, it makes the Stormcloaks the weaker side of the civil war in terms of storytelling.
23	According to a recent report, 50% of the scientists in NASA are Indian IITians. Imagine what would happen if those scientists were to join ISRO - India's status, value and astronomical knowledge would undoubtedly increase.   Now, think about the IITians - students who are qualifying IIT. They are known to be superbrains. India is capable of opening hitech institutions, yet we are unable to provide them with perfect jobs of their level. This is due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, inadequate working environment, and insufficient salary. This is something that needs to be addressed immediately in order to maximize India's potential.
24	All these arguments about porn leading to addiction are annoying me now -_- . Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met.
25	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." This means that Blacks and Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison. I feel this is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]
26	So you dispute the Pontias Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter.  Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.
27	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.  However, there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.
28	I would say not all foreigners ..maybe unrealistic but it would depend on what country they are from ..er which country..Just as the entire world has favs and non favs.. I think the non favs for countries already know who they are and why...If a nation is violent and not good for the world and the government..lies and steals..and kills innocent humans..well then.. it is not well liked ..or the people either..because the government is suppose to represent the people..So...it is the government that causes it and their people that pay for it.
29	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. Moreover, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
30	I just don't know if you are referring Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people who were born south of the USA may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have slightly similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all "Latinos" are the same, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latin America. You don't say to an Irish he is British or to a Canadian he is American or to a Basque he is Spanish. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
31	I don't think its a waste of time but i think it is pointless because our world ( Earth ) Has its own bigger problem like world poverty, population, pollution, and the biggest threat...Global Warming. Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could be focusing on our world problems first and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and near the end we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientists caring too much about other things when there lives also could be in stake.
32	I don't think that it should be a government choice. It should be the owner of the property's choice. I have yet to be somewhere where smoke bothered me because most places are non-smoking. Bars here in Ohio aren't most anyway, and that doesn't bother me at all. Maybe the next day after smelling my clothes and hair, but my breath probably stinks just as bad after a night of drinks. This is just a way of people controlling and getting money. One of the issues on the ballot if you read closely says money for the "clean air fund". If they ban smoking why would you need a clean air fund? And what on earth are you going to do with that money? I prefer my money to go to my child's college fund.
33	What an excellent question! Let's see, this is a poor woman? An immigrant? Not a middle class white woman? A woman whose family is not being torn to shreds over an agonizing decision about which they don't agree? This isn't an election year? The Shrub is in enough hot water with the public without having this situation getting the same headlines that Schiavo's case garnered? In any case, while I agree whole heartedly with your implication that the "Culture of Life" folks are a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites, I find that I am a little grateful that this lady was permitted to die without being at the center of a terrible storm of public controversy played out among people who don't even know her.Cold comfort, but it's all I have some days. I'm very grateful she had family with her, shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively.   So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked?  I prefer the first option.  Hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
35	People are free to make their own decisions in life. Yes, maybe it sucks that there are consequences to it, but really you should teach your kids about responsibility and teach them to talk about it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.
37	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.  That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People — whether voters or legislators — pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.  And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
38	Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly, I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
39	Its not Morally right. I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion but I know that in my heart its wrong and not an option for me. But I would much rather have these women who have their mind set on doing it go to a clean, sterile facility and not some rusty shack and but their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts etc. I think every one knows its not morally right they aren't motivated to have an abortion bc its morally right I think they choose to because of situational factors. N I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their option but they felt that was their only way out.
40	If your father's insurance goes up, you should pay it. It will likely be reviewed within six months. However, the good news is that it is just a learning experience. You got a ticket for improper passing, but it could have been worse; at least you were not at fault. You are likely insured on your father's policy since you were a passenger, so it will not cost you a penny. Your friend is responsible for the ticket since he was the one at fault, since he did not list you as a separate driver on his insurance. It is his problem, not yours.
41	I'm not talking about my parents here. They are wonderful people. I meant grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (Not brothers / sisters either, only child). Most of my parent's argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for you. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
42	Dear Friend,  I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.  But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.  Your Friend, Francesois
43	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I pissed. Over time I began to do it more often. Now I muti-task quite often by sitting to piss while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to piss when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean tha it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.
44	Firstly, does your bf own the company or is he a worker? Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your bf has done something like cross a picket line , then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man is he really an illegal allien? Then INS could come in and send him back .  You know unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecing the work they do.  When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group.  Unions are not all demons nor is management always the enemy however if that's how management and union posture themselves then there won't be any kind of labour peace.
45	Throughout the debate over the Washington Redskins name, I have often heard the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is equivalent to having a team named the Detroit N*****s.  This to me is illogical: First off, when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context.
46	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
47	There is no provision in either the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution which says that keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom.    Now, our founding fathers were involved in colony governments before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights.     When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation, we were not opposed to taxation. We never have been.
48	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.  The fourth Amendment is not enough to protect our privacy from the government-- they have access to so much more now than when the amendment was written.  Therefore, it's important for us to know what they are doing with our money and our lives.
49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, due to faith based reasons. These reasons include the fact that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house.  That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
50	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art". But hasn't almost all installation art since then been Duchamp's Fountain over and over again. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc.  Almost all contemporary installation art is criminally dull and boring. The 100th attempt at asking the question 'what is art' just leaves me dripping with apathy.  It does not push the boundaries in any way and is simply a reproduction of something else the viewer may have already seen.  The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh as people walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, it's the opposite. They're proudly put on display.  I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
51	Yes, the president should be impeached. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are not aware of the war crimes and crimes against humanity that George W. Bush, because of multiple instances of "misinformation" that was given, or possibly not as a result of, we must all agree that George W. Bush is one that should be impeached. Remember this: while Bush is not currently the worst, he is among the worst, and we must find someone more competent with the politics and world affairs of the United States of America that will bring us into this time of need for leadership, albeit only for two years. With that, let us vote PRO to impeach Bush, a committer of multiple crimes against the people of the United States of America.

Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip. To maintain the purity of our water, we employ a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system that involves carefully controlled and continuously monitored disinfection processes in hygienically designed lines. We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. Every year, we screen for over 200 possible contaminants-far more than state and federal regulations require.
53	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to step up and fight for them. California is pretty fair when it comes to dads. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you. Unless you are found unfit for some reason, your court order should stand. You need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction from the latest court order. Good luck and you really need fight for this. Your kids need to have contact with their father, it may scar them for life, but you don't want them to think you abandoned them.
54	I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or an extremely bad start in life. However the majority of poor Americans are content, and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society. I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I feel lazy allot of the time, I almost feel like I am entitled to sit around and play video games all day, but I have to remind myself that the world humans created does not work that way, that we must work for everything we get. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in 3rd world countries work their whole lives to just survive, but we have grown up on video games and easy high school.
55	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, I just don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science.   I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
56	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However this would only be the case of course if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
57	I am from Illinois, and I believe I have a case for workers' compensation or something of that nature? Not really cause you didn't fill out an accident report and your work will argue you did it at home and you have not proof that you did it on the job. If you do hire a lawyer, you better be ready to fight a long and powerful battle and, nine times out of ten, you will lose, as it is worth more losing your job and potentially getting blacklisted from getting another one. When you fill out an application, your ex-employer can blackball you and tell them what happened and you won't get the job.
58	Yes, what good does it do to punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free while throwing the potheads in prison?  Just because it has been illegal forever doesn't mean that it's right.  Spitting in the street is illegal in some places, too.  Luckily, in some states, it's pretty much ignored.  Those interested in this should check out the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
59	I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics.  Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up.  This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly).  It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution.  To really properly analyse these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point).  The statistics for African-Americans is even worse - something like 6000+ African-American inmates per 100,000.
60	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Well either way, yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then he/she is hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive way. That does not mean they should not be allowed to vote. On the hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should  not be able to -- especially if they are repeat offenders.
61	I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and had unlimited access to Rudy's. Loved their brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to Phx for 4 years then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes we have Rudy's but they're not nearly as accessible as they are in ATX. So I think Ive been once in 2 years. Went for a wkd trip to Phx at the end of July and low and behold what do e drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend had never been so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately my friend wasn't a fan of the sauce.. too peppery for her liking. I loved every second..not so much the brisket/egg taco but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. OMFG! Delish! Will miss you!
62	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marriageto just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other. Enough said.
63	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way you choose to look at a fetus...it is still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn't want to get pregnant in the first place...don't have sex or use protection.  Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the growing being have to pay the ultimate price of its life?
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish.   In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still-live bodies and tossed them in to the water.   I can't find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their faces, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten.   At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through their face, fought for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, and then removed the hook and started over.   I did not like it. Except... I DID.
65	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment.  I've been in this region my entire life, and even though we took a battering economy wise, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area, since it's nothing more than God's waiting room. Tourism is an economic driver, but it shouldn't be the only one.
66	We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there scratching each others' backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate.  Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits.  Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System, that is.    The Good Ole' Boys are just biding their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves.
67	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about Spaghetti? Quoting the transformers movies? Karma is spewing out and overflowing and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can't you people have your own thoughts, or is every concept you grasp dependent on it being intermediated by a career actor mouthing lines that have been signed off by a committee of movie company executives? I'm sickened.
68	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us.  Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
69	Depends on your state...Here in Nebraska Legal Majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that support is necessary through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a swift kick in the pants! It is a very difficult thing to deal with...watching your daughter self-destruct but it sounds like you have no choice. IF she was still living with her father you should be giving him money towards her support...if she is "on her own" in her own apartment, you have no obligation to pay an 18yr olds rent.  I would tell her she is on her own...IF she wants to come home and finish High School she can...but if she wants to be a Junkie...she is on her own. She can move into the Dope mans house, get a job, or join the army. All you can do is keep a light on and pray...but you dont have to pay...
70	I understand the Democratic Party collects the most money from PACs. I understand as a union guy that our dues are paltry, and the Teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
71	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names "raffles institution" "raffles hospital" raffles medical clinics"
72	EXCUSE ME! wow someone is very agressive...me? nah I tell the truth...17 years old...very athletic...joined the army reserves recently and I'm a straight A student who might occaisonally recieve a B+...so I'm not retarded, which I think accusing people of being retards is a very rude thing to say because retardation is an unfortunaste thing to happen to any person and there are actual retards out there, and I'm entering my senior year of high school meaning i haven't dropped out...and since I'm active and very athletic I'm not a lazy fat ass...thank you very much!
73	I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game.  Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off. I think professional soccer players who over exaggerate injuries should receive a yellow card.
74	I believe that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it does not harm anyone else in the process. As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmless when compared to other drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco. They also are not addictive. If they are only found to improve the user's quality of life, and are not addictive or harmful, then I do not see why they should remain illegal.
75	If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a "bad" place, which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street.   What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests.   And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED (ie: innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn't make any sense at all.
76	In the public eyes, Iraq does not deserve the same freedom we have because we are standing back and fighting the terrorists for the people of the world from the terrorists who rule it. We are freedom fighters who fight for freedom, justice, and liberty. Unfortunately, people have lost sight of it, and voted the wrong way yesterday.   Finally, for the budget, we pay for it in the long run with our taxes, not with the so-called federal and state money people think we have.
77	It is likely that if there were no weapons, there would be less control over the masses, which would be a good thing. There would also be fewer wars as factions would be unable to wage war against one another as efficiently. Additionally, there would be less destruction in the form of buildings, infrastructure, etc. as there would be less opportunities for conflicts to develop into larger wars.  In addition, there would simply be calm areas of the world, and some areas may remain calm due to a lack of weapons, while other areas may remain calm due to better police/government control.
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way.
79	Having a lousy father can be beneficial in that you can blame every mistake you've made on him. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think you need it. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually better than having a fatherless home because at least you know he doesn't care as much.
80	CarCraze --- you are wrong, sorry to say  What you have there, my dear, is a bona fide Court Order for you to appear in court to answer to a Motion to Collect a Debt. If it is on Court paper and has a case number, call the Court to confirm the Docket Number, and find out when the hearing date is.  YES, they do have that power.  YES, That is the equivalent of a Subpoena.  If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it GONE !  What you should do:  Seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you.  DON'T HESITATE - you will regret it.
81	I agree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is an absurd thought. One of the reasons they are illegal is that they do harm the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the players' health because they are too young to see the consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models to too many young kids. You do not want kids walking around pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending they have boobs. This will encourage the use of steroids for younger kids because their favorite athletes are on them. Not only will you see a rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs in professional players, but in nonprofessional players as well. If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, it would cause all athletes to start using regardless if they want to or not because they will feel that they need to take them just to be able to compete with the other athletes.
82	Well, the problem is -- until these people have actually been charged with and convicted of some crime, she can't just remove them, absent a supermajority vote of the House.   Improper conduct for a judge may be nothing more than a violation of a judicial ethical rule, and could be something as simple as allowing the appearance of impropriety. It can happen where the judge has never broken the law or even never actually done anything unethical -- just the appearance is enough to remove the judge sometimes. But just that appearance is not grounds for forcibly removing an elected official from office. They need to actually have done done something illegal, generally at felony level.
83	Here's another thing to consider...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliation, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case seperately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! Scary stuff.
84	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after despite massive public outcry. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her. But recently to my disbelief I met a man from London who believed she was a great leader.
85	Cosleeping can be dangerous for babies, as it increases the risk of them being rolled or falling out of the bed or being too close to the parents' bed. It also can destroy intimacy between the parents. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience as they can be put near the bed and make feeding easier. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. It should always be discouraged and never encouraged. CMV.
86	If you were the dad: You could always just give extra money that doesn't go throught the courthouse.  Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.   Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own.  You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own.   Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place.   Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job.  It goes by a percentage of his income.
87	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literate, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enough potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then". **This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc**  Employer might not be able to afford an employee a raise, but they should be able to provide enough work for the employee to earn more than minimum wage if the job warrants it. The type of job also does not determine if an employer can offer a raise or not, it's up to the individual employer to decide if they can afford it or not.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider or act on suicide, they have the strength to continue living. It's not a pleasant thing to do, but it is a choice a person is capable of making. Suicide is not an option i find necessary and that a person who commit are stupid. So, topic is "if you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to live on". Change my view over this topic as I am open to all responses from you all.
90	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a hand gun? I know other states are even harder to deal with....New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.   It is disturbing that there is not a national standard on the gun law. Should individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something straight out of the Constitution?
91	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike".   All it accomplishes is:  * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit  * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society   It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to 'act like a lady'). And god forbid that men have some values that women are 'supposed' to have.   Why not have a gender neutral phrase? "Be a better person"?
92	This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive,  then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas...  several kilos of food here for less than £4. if you have a big enough freezer you can even buy chicken breast in bulk thatll last months (£48/10kg here)...Then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain healthy food is expensive).
93	Yeah, it's biased.  But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet search records of Americans over to Bush and Co. in the administration's guise of cracking down on porn?  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda.  And it was dumb to pose that question.  It is a crime to threaten the President and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way--especially by this president.  But I've noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then are fine with it.  I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math science or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be there own unique awesome person, advancing human towards the next step in our history.
95	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other peoples' opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.   In many cases it could be conservatism is masquerading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything.   On the other hand, pro-choice could be called inconsistent. Just as an parent may believe their life would be better if the foetus didn't exist, the U.S. may feel it more convenient if the nation of Iraq is a bloody mess.   Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
96	Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured , then killed by other cars passing over it.  My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will at bit unpleasant is not something one should show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another Field. I am a wage earner, I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road.   It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way.  This is not about arguing whether road kill is bad or good for the environment, rather my own emotional reaction to seeing a animal die senselessly. I am arguing it is fine to experience no emotion.
97	I believe the rules for debate topics should be posted or sent to members. Three debates in one day criticizing my views on upholding convinceme's seriousness is no longer desired, I will flag them. He is the ONLY administrator for this website, what he says goes. He has left us as a community to make our own decisions. I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community.  I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily run over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve.  # Input:  I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily run over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve.

98	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty. But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the Glaring eyes & stance when in court he recently told the judge, “I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?” The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddam’s case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts? No. The chair will probably decay and break, and the switches/wires will rust or melt away.
99	The Cold War is over, there's no more USSR, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, communist and or dictatorship countries. There are many US bases, agricultural companies, and tourist attractions that could potentially open up Cuban society as US business takes hold on the island, and increased tourism would help make contact with Cubans. It is clear that the current policy has been a failure, and 48 years of non-change does not suggest that it will bring about change. A new policy needs to be established in order to bring about real change.
