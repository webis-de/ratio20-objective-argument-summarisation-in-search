0	The argument that porn could potentially expose one to the reality in life and increase one's maturity, and prevent future sexual assaults, is not without its risks.  Porn can definitely be a slippery slope, and it is not a path I would recommend for everyone. It is better to avoid it if one is not sure it won't become a regular habit, because it can easily take up a lot of time and energy that could be used for other things.  It should not be taken lightly, as it is as harmful as smoking and drugs. I think the main reason it is not banned in most developed countries is that it is not seen as an immediate threat to public health like smoking and drugs are.
1	No I haven't but (it sounds like its a friend) and it sounds like she can get help through a pro-bono place , or a low income based legal services . You would be surprised at what some places consider LOW INCOME . My sister's husband brings home at least $400.00 a week in the winter and at least $600.00 a week in summer , and they have a 3 person household. They get around $46,000 a year and bring home around $46,000 a year, and they get help from W.I.C., Daycare Assistance, etc.
2	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil". However, if both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Even if all participants are consenting, this to me is not necessarily a form of consensual BDSM, as everyone involved must be in some sense vulnerable, and therefore could be seen as some form of sadomasochism.  Picking apart the elements, it is the aspect of the person being 'assisted' in the activity which leaves me with a feeling of unease.
3	I think we should be investing significant funds in research to create cool combinations of animals. For example, a half gorilla-half octopus, with the face resembling that of an octopus and having 2 legs and 6 wavy arms, plus a furry coat.  I don't agree with the "don't play god" argument - I'm not concerned about creating abnormal combinations because I feel the resulting animals would be worth the effort.  Imagine having a turtle with a chicken head walking around your house - it would be remarkable!  Sure the research would be costly, but I believe the end results would be remarkable.
4	Gun control is a controversial topic, and statistics show that guns do make a difference in crime rates. Citizens with guns are able to stop crimes more effectively than without them, and the Second Amendment is in place to allow citizens the ability to fight back against a government that may become oppressive. Also, hunting rifles vs. machine guns is not a fair comparison - guns with greater firepower are better able to counteract government force.  The right to bear arms is there to allow citizens the ability to fight back against a government that may go too far.
5	Being horny is a natural feeling and not a sin. Having sex with your girlfriend is not a sin. Rape is a crime, and if it happens it is a terrible thing, but if two consenting adults have sex, it is not wrong. We should teach respect and communication instead of religion, as it is not a religion-specific concept.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, lesbians are more "socially acceptable" than gay men, because women are considered to be inherently less of an interest in romantic relationships, but the female equivalent of a man's sexual orientation is still seen as more acceptable.  Additionally, gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.  Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is considered to be more socially acceptable.  Lesbians also have an advantage in that they are more accepted by straight people, as there is no male presence to make straight women feel uncomfortable during the interactions.
7	This guy's actually got a point. I'm not so sure on the specifics of any Yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances of arbitrary detention and other human rights violations have reduced in recent years, but torture and other forms of ill-treatment are still a regular part of the Chinese legal system. America should hold China to account for these abuses, but our concerns of economic ties mean we sometimes choose to turn a blind eye.  The Chinese government's crackdown on dissent should not be ignored, as it suppresses freedom of speech and other basic rights.
8	Nuitsen, I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. What was done in Iraq was horrible, but it is still not the same thing - the drawings were created to mock the Prophet, something which iam not a fan of but what was done in Iraq was done in the name of a political and military conflict.  Islam, so we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs - they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq, but I don't see anybody protesting about that. The drawings were very offensive but I don't see that the government or the people of Denmark have censored them which is worrying.  Melliare?  The difference is that the suicide bombers were acting in response to a political and military conflict, while the drawings were done in response to the Prophet. Denmark has the right to censor what it finds offensive and has in the past when it comes to the prophet, for example by taking the cartoons down from the website. That was done to avoid any unrest.
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and still experience hardship in life. Conversely, if you take a go-getter approach and aim to succeed, you may still meet with success. People who are successful in life tend to do so because they were determined and worked towards their goals. Life is not always fair in this regard.   I have seen both scenarios play out, where someone does the right thing and gets ahead in life, and where people who are successful are those who take initiative and push for what they want.  I believe that success in life is a result of one's determination and hard work, not based on whether things are fair or not.
10	Scott Peterson was the counterpoint to OJ Simpson. He was not a celebrity but an "everyman". Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci were attractive people, so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reasons we watched Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. He was just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality was shocking and left everyone with a lasting impression. 1) Don't lose sight of your sense of morality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic. 2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off as easily as a black celebrity, where the public is concerned.
11	Hamas has fired around 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to secure a ceasefire without retaliation. Hamas' declining/ignoring these opportunities for peace have left Israel with no other option but to retaliate for the safety of Israeli citizens. With the main goal of Hamas being to destroy Israel, Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas in order to ensure the safety of its citizens. Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively firing missiles from civilian buildings. I believe the disregard for civilian casualties by Hamas and continual bombing of Israel is enough of a justification to launch an invasion of Gaza and prevent further bombings.
12	This debate has clarified for me that the government should not be in the marriage business. Let the churches perform marriages for whoever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all. As for polygamous marriages, they exist, but there is not a substantial part of the population which supports them. That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite distinct. In my opinion, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing through, and it feels like no one really cares about the projects they are doing. For example, I did a final year project that was self-proposed, and I really enjoyed it and wanted to keep working on it, but it seemed that everyone else was just going through the motions. It seemed that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do, it just seems like a production line for the corporate world.
14	bad company is boring due to its huge maps and vehicles, and the controls are weird - it's hard to control the vehicles. The maps are way too big and the game is boring because you never know where the enemy is. You don't have to go looking for them, and the maps are too big to go out of your way to kill someone. On MW2, you're thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to develop. Weapons on MW2 are realistic except for the AT4 which is not a guided munition.   bad company 2 vs call of duty  is much more intense due to its ability to surprise you with enemies coming from all around and you have to be ready to defend yourself. On battlefield, you get thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to develop - unlike MW2 where you know the enemy is coming and you have to be ready to get them.
15	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to the public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty). Televising executions in the United States would serve to show the public more accurate information on what is taking place.
16	You can't impose democracy by force in countries with a different background and religious beliefs.  Muslim countries don't have the Enlightenment background we had in the US, which is essential for forming a secular Constitutional Republic.  Islam teaches that the rule of law must come from the Koran, making it difficult to form a democracy.  Ultimately, military force is the only way to keep control in these countries, which can lead to blowback.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught., but if the law is unjust and oppressive, people may choose to take a stand and break it to uphold their rights. Also, if the penalty is not severe, like speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc., your right to take the law to court would be justified if the law is unjust or if it invades the realms of Human rights or religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify it.
18	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk AKA Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always right - Hulk is more powerful.  As you know, Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, but the Hulk is essentially unbeatable.  He simply does not have the strength to defeat the Hulk in battle.  With that being said, if Optimus Prime is able to gain the upper hand and weaken the Hulk, then he could win. But it will be difficult.  The Hulk wins almost every time against Optimus Prime. He is incredibly tough and has enough strength to beat Optimus Prime even in cases where the Transformer is at his peak performance.
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).   The argument is that it's considerate but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out.   And in a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again.   Putting the seat down after use is a matter of respect and hygiene, yet it is not something that should be put in a shared toilet without some contact with the seat.  Basically the expectation for men to put the seat down after urinating is an unreasonable request in a public or shared toilet setting.
20	You are incorrect, the bars have not been shut down in India, the ban is only in Maharashtra. The Government had shut them down due to numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money at the ladies bars and not looking after the families. Additionally, many criminal activities took place at these bars. You must be aware of the Tarnami and Telgi cases, where Tarnami's monthly income was frozen at around 1 lac and Telgi was throwing around 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To stop such criminal activities, the Government of Maharashtra had imposed a ban on these ladies bars.
21	Marriage has always been between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. I don't want my tax money to go towards rewarding couples who live together. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned behavior, I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society.
22	Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villains out of the two choices their( the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker part of the skyrim story. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist in that they use forced involuntary servitude to get people to join their faction and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morale, and also what they do to the jewelery shop and adras is not something you'd expect from a good faction. Secondly, Ulfric uses thu'um to kill the high king, which is literally the most power he can use at the time, to me. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head off at the beginning.   Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks are not just Saturday morning cartoon villains. The use of force to take over the throne makes them evil, but the way they go about it with the adras and the jewelry shop things is up to the player to decide.  Additionally, the storm-cloaks literally have no backstory or dialogue that makes them good.  The thing that makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys in my opinion is that they clearly do not believe in the law of the realm and only kill the high king at the point of a sword, which is not something you'd expect from a good faction.   Also it does make the storm-cloaks the more interesting side of the story if they are just given the quest to kill the high king and it's up to the player to make a choice on what to do with the adras.  They have the jewelery shop and adras to take over, make them the villains with no real choice in the matter.  Additionally, the storm-cloaks are simply the villains because of the way they go about taking over the crown, with force and the adras and the jewelery shop.   They use force to take over the throne which makes them the villains, but the way they go about it is up to the player to decide.
23	according to a recent report, around 50% of the scientists in NASA are Indian IITians. Imagine what would happen if these scientists were to join ISRO - India's status, value and astronomical knowledge would undoubtedly increase. Now, consider IITians. Students who qualify IIT are known to be superbrainy. If India is capable of opening up high-tech institutions, why is it unable to provide them with ideal job opportunities of their level? This is mainly due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, inadequate salary, and unfavorable working conditions. Improving the industrial sector should be a priority.
24	All these arguments about porn leading to addiction are annoying me - I've never had an issue with it. Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met.
25	For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women when it comes to car insurance. Insurance rates should not be determined by the statistical population but rather by individual risk factors such as driving history.
26	So you dispute the Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Jesus was ultimately executed for sedition - claiming to be the King of the Jews and leading a revolt against the Roman occupation.
27	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are some aspects of reservation which are beneficial as it helps people in the lower strata of society to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.  However, there is opposition to it because the benefit of it are not going to the actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in a higher class and the actual needy people are still at the same place.
28	I would say that not all foreigners are not well received in some Russian regions, depending on the area they are from. Just like the entire world has favorites and non-favorites, I think the non-favorite regions for Russia are those that have had negative experiences with the government and its people in the past. The people of the region also pay for it.
29	Yes, I think that unlimited freedom of speech should be the norm. However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was still irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries.  However, I also think that the Islamic world is overreacting. They are damaging their own reputation by reacting in such a way. How many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians would burn down embassies if they were offended by similar content?
30	I just don't know if you are referring Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have a slightly similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all "Latinos" are the same, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latin America.  You don't say to an Irish he is British or to a Canadian he is American or to a Basque he is Spanish. Culture should not be an excuse for doing something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions.
31	I don't think its a waste of time, but I think that our focus should be on Earth's problems first and try to fix those, rather than trying to make other planets better to live on. What if our focus on Earth is not enough and everyone dies if we don't fix other planets first? Global Warming is the biggest threat to our world, and scientists should try to find ways to make other planets better to live on while we are there.
32	I don't think it should be a government decision - it should be the owner of the property's choice. Here in Ohio, most bars are non-smoking which doesn't bother me. Smoke bothers me the next day after a night of drinks, but my breath probably still smells just as bad. This is just a way of people controlling and making money - if they ban smoking, why would you need a clean air fund? If it passes, I won't have a choice will I?
33	The doctor's decision to withhold treatment was made in accordance with the family's wishes and with the support of the hospital's palliative care team. Despite being given medication to alleviate her pain, the woman's suffering worsened and she died a few days later.  The hospital sought to balance the family's wishes with their desire to provide compassionate care, and the lady's family was with her during her final days. A multi-disciplinary team of doctors, nurses and a chaplain provided her with the best possible care.  The hospital was praised for the way they managed the situation, with her family being present and in consultation with the hospital's palliative care team. 15.  The lady's family was with her during her final days, and a multi-disciplinary team of doctors, nurses and a chaplain provided her with the best possible care. 15.

34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships effectively protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option.  Hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? No, with the high risk of pirate attacks.   Yes, the U.S. should deploy more ships in this area to provide better protection to the trade routes and countries.
35	People are free to make there own decisions in life. Yeah, maybe it sucks that there is such a big influence of peer pressure and societal pressure, but really you want your kids to be safe and make the best choices.  Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dangerous.  Maybe you should teach your kids about responsibility and learn to trust them. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are vulnerable to all kinds of coercion, from drug dealers as well as other influences. You should know that from when you were younger. The more you can teach your kids about protecting themselves, the better. Teens can be vulnerable to exploitation in a number of ways, such as online and in person.  The more you can teach your kids about protection, the better, such as about using condoms and other forms of safe sex.  Teenagers are also vulnerable to unintended pregnancies, which can be a great strain on the family. The best way to protect yourself is to use contraception, such as condoms and other forms of safe sex.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location when Germany was allocated as the birthplace of Judaism? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. In regards to Israel, had it been established within the borders of Germany, this could have provided a safer homeland for the Jews in the aftermath of the Holocaust.  On a historical note, had Israel been established within the borders of Germany, it would have been a separate and independent state, rather than part of a larger German state as it was established.
37	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.
38	Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so I'll provide some info about Christianity. Christianity is based on the belief that Jesus is the Son of God, who was born of the virgin Mary and through his death on the cross provided the way to forgiveness of sins and eternal life. I believe in Jesus Christ as my personal savior and that is the foundation of my faith. It is impossible to prove that God exists, but I feel in my heart that he does.  It's up to each individual to make a personal decision regarding faith in God.  The main point of Christianity is not that you have to prove God exists, but that you have to have faith in him and that faith is based on the belief that Jesus is the Son of God. > 11.

In this sentence, the word "real" can be replaced with "actual" to indicate that the value of the home is based on the particular location rather than just looking at the market trend of the particular location. 11. Input: The actual estate price is influenced by the amount of supply and demand for the particular location, and the amount of supply and demand for the particular location is what ultimately determines the actual estate price, not just by looking at the particular location's market
39	Its not Morally right. I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion but I know that in my heart its wrong and not an option for me. But I would much rather have these women go to a clean, sterile facility and not some rusty shack if they're willing to risk their health. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts etc. I think every one knows it isn't morally right, and they feel that way mainly because of the situation. N I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their option but they felt that was their only way out.
40	ethically, if your father's insurance goes up you should pay it. It will probably be reviewed within six months. However, the good news is this is just a learning experience. You got a ticket for improper passing, which is not a big deal. She got a ticket because she was half at fault at least. Let's say there is a big medical bill. You are probably insured on your father's policy had you been at fault. Your friend has the problem and he is totally at fault. He let you use the car. Now if there is a big claim, he is not insured because he did not list you as a separate driver and he might have to pay out of his pocket. This is his problem, not yours. I don't see this as an ethical problem for you since you are insured.
41	I'm not talking about my parents here. They are wonderful people. I meant grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc.  (Not brothers / sisters either, only child).  The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for me. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't need them to help me. I only care about the person if they can show me things that make them unique and special. To me, family is more about connection and emotional bonds, not just something based on blood.  I don't feel the same way about my family that I do about some random people I interact with. It's similar to how I feel about strangers - the connection just isn't there.
42	Dear Friend,  Insurance companies are allowed to profile in terms of risk assessment, i.e. charging higher premiums to customers in certain areas with higher accident rates, but law enforcement officers do not have this capability. Additionally, insurance companies do not have the capacity to put people in jail or prison.  Law enforcement, however, has the power to do so. Insurance companies sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies, while law enforcement has the power to make a huge difference in people's lives based on their actions.  I'm not sure I agree with the premise that insurance companies are allowed to profile in terms of risk assessment but law enforcement is not. Insurance companies should be held to the same standards regardless of the type of service they provide.  Francesois  I would argue that insurance companies should not be allowed to profile in terms of risk assessment any more than law enforcement is allowed to profile in terms of race or religion.  Insurance companies should assess risk based on relevant factors, such as claim history or credit score, but not on factors that would cause them to unfairly single out certain people.  Regards, Francesois
43	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multitask by brushing my teeth while I peed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I peed. Over time I began to do it more often. Now I multitask quite often by sitting to pee while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to pee when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to pee so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to pee with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.
44	Firstly does your bf own the company or is he a worker?  Secondly unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your bf has done something like cross a picket line , then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab.  As for the other man is he really an illegal alien?  Some states have laws allowing workers to organize and sign up members to a union.  In this case the employee can join and pay the dues and fees that are required for membership, so the union has the right to represent them in labour disputes.  Unions are an important tool in helping employers and employees reach labour peace, as they can help with resolving disputes over wages and conditions of employment.
45	Throughout the debate with the Washington Redskins, I keep hearing the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is equivalent to having a team named the Detroit N***. This to me is illogical: First off, when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? To me, Redskin is not equivalent to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context. It is not similar at all to using the N word in terms of how it is used in context.
46	I feel that a personal pursuit is better than advancing the common good. Your personal pursuit should come first because it is something that you would do for yourself. But if someone in your family is in need, you will help them out even if they are related to you. If it is someone you don't know, you will help the family member instead of just a random person.
47	There is no provision in either document you cite which says that the right to keep all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom.  The founding fathers were involved in colony governments before they were involved in the revolution. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights. When we had the revolution, we were opposed to taxation without representation. We never were. Taxation was more about the general fund than individuals.
48	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's a concern when anyone does-- celebrities, photographers, publications, or the government-- because it's with our money.  Governments have a right to know what they're doing with our data-- because it's our income and health information that's being monitored.  The 4th Amendment is supposed to protect our privacy from the government, but with SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure, phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so powerful and capable that businesses are being forced to collude with it and give up whatever privacy we had left.
49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens in the 9/11 attacks. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house. That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky ones will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and they will be indefinitely detained without any legal proceedings for a long period of time.
50	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art". But hasn't almost all installation art since then been Duchamp's Fountain over and over again. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc.  The same goes for much of the contemporary installation art - it is just boring old art that has been installed in a gallery. I would love to see some of it in a more dynamic setting - a park, for example, or even just outside the gallery doors. It'd bring a new energy and life to the art, and make it more interesting. Installation art, as it stands, is just a bit tedious - it's overwhelmed by a sense of sameness.
51	Yes, the president should be impeached. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are not aware of the war crimes and crimes against humanity that George W. Bush committed, as a result of multiple instances of "misinformation" that was given, or possibly not as a result of, we must all agree that George W. Bush must be impeached. Remember this: while Bush is not currently the worst, he is among the worst, and we must find someone more competent with the politics and world affairs of the United States of America that will bring us into this time of need for leadership, albeit only for two years. With that, let us vote PRO to impeach Bush, a committer of multiple crimes against the people of the United States of America.  The crimes that he has committed as president are of a very serious nature and warrant impeachment. > > > > > > >   # Impeachment should be carried out for crimes that George W. Bush has committed against the people of the United States of America, such as his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, his violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, and his authorization of wiretaps without court orders, etc. > > > > > > > >   > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >
52	At Poland Spring, we take great pride in ensuring the highest quality water is consistently delivered. We employ a comprehensive multi-barrier filtration system with highly controlled disinfection processes and rigorously tested water coming in, as well as screened for over 200 contaminants more than state and federal regulations require. http://delivery.polandspring.com/Delivery/home/help/OurWater.aspx
53	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to step up and fight for them. California is pretty fair when it comes to dads. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you. Unless you are found unfit for some reason, the law will favor dads in the court's latest order. Do you have a court order? You need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction from the latest court order. Good luck and you really need to fight for this.  In order to have contact with your children, you need to fight for your legal rights as a father.  It is important to get a court order as the law will favor dads in the lastest court order.
54	I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or an extremely bad start in life. However the majority of poor Americans are content, and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society. I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I feel that the society we have created has made us lazy, as I feel like I am entitled to sit around and play video games all day. However, I also feel that the US education system does not prepare us to compete in the world. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in third world countries work their whole lives to just survive, but we have grown up in an environment with so many opportunities that we have become lazy in our expectations.
55	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, I just don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science.   I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. Skepticism is always a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
56	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, then if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if faster than us it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However, this would only be the case of course if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise, it would never be our equal.
57	not really cause u didn't fill out an accident report and your work will argue u did it at home and u have no case doe that i nothing was reported and you have no proof that u did it on the job that is why even a minor cut should be reported to your supervisor or u have no case did u tell anyone that your back was hurting before u left work and if u did they have to sign an affidavit that u did hurt yourself on the job and put their job in jeopardy and risk losing their job too so if u do hire a lawyer u better be ready to fight a long and powerful battle and nine times outta ten u lose so it is best to go to the chiropractor keep your job and mark this up as a lesson the next time something minor happens do make sure to fill out the accident report and inform your employer so that it does not become a major issue.
58	I think it is time that America reforms its marijuana laws.  Marijuana has been illegal for decades, but it is still used widely across the country and it is not right that people are punished for something that is essentially not against the law in the majority of states.  In some places, it is actually just ignored, which is not right.  It is time for reforms in these areas.  Those interested in these reforms should get in touch with NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. #2013 California was one of the few states where marijuana possession was largely ignored.
59	I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics.  Our crime rate is going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up. This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" that started in the late 70s/early 80s (Reagan, mostly). It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution. To really properly analyze these numbers, you also need to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, so the rates are even worse). The statistics for African Americans are even worse - something like 6000+ African American inmates per 100,000.
60	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Yes, however, there are some criminals that have the potential to be reformed and deserving a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, that person is capable of changing and learning the right lessons in life. That doesn't mean they should not be able to vote. On the other hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should not have the privilege to vote.  I believe that people with criminal offenses like these should not be allowed to vote.
61	I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and had unlimited access to Rudy's. Loved their brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to Phx for 4 years then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes we have Rudy's but they're not nearly as accessible as they are in ATX. So I think Ive been once in 2 years. Went for a wkd trip to Phx at the end of July and low and behold what do e drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend had never been so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately my friend wasn't a fan of the sauce.. too peppery for her liking. I loved every second..not so much the brisket/egg taco but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. OMFG! Delish! Well now Im moving back to CT so Im sure Rudy's is in my pat but Im glad I got one last taste. Im going to miss them.
62	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in any way affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. If two people want to show their commitment to each other by getting married, it should be legal for them to do so. Gay or straight, marriage should be an option for everyone.
63	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way you view a fetus, it is still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way. You shouldn't be changing what nature has decided for you. If you didn't want to get pregnant in the first place, use protection to protect against pregnancy. Yeah, there are some women who get pregnant due to rape, and it is unfortunate, but they should give the child up for adoption. It is not the child's fault that it was created in this situation.  The decision of whether to keep the baby or not should ultimately be the child's.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. To catch these fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still-live bodies and tossed them in to the water.  I cannot find any justification for this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their faces, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering ended when they were eaten.  At the same time, I did not enjoy the experience. Except for the actual catching of the fish, which I did not like.  Fishing experts - what do you think? Did I suffer the fish more because I fought them?  I did find that the fish suffered more when I fought them. } I was still able to release them all successfully.
65	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment.   I've been in this region my entire life, and even though we took a battering economy-wise, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area, since it's mainly reliant on tourism. There needs to be more economic diversity.  For my future potential relocation, I'd like to go to Tampa Bay should I have the means to do so.  I understand why this area is mostly made up of tourism, though it shouldn't be the only one.
66	We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there who have been there for decades. They've got their own little system going, and they're doing quite well financially. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate to break up the monopoly and bring in fresh minds.   Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits, but it is not fair that they are able to stay there for the rest of their lives and still vote on issues that affect the rest of us.   Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. They need to have a system in place where more than one person is elected to Office to make sure everyone gets a fair shake.   The system needs to be changed to prevent any one individual or party from continuously blocking everything. People need to have the opportunity to put their own Bills up and have them passed.  It's a system that is set up to benefit the incumbents, who have the power and reap the benefits of all the legislation they have put in place. We need to put in place term limits that will help break up the monopoly and ensure fresher, more diverse minds are elected.  The system needs to be able to have term limits of no more than two terms in both House and Senate to prevent someone from staying there for a long time and taking away the people's ability to elect new people and change the system.  Need to enact term limits on elected officials so that people can go in and vote out those who are in office. We do not need people who are in office for a long time and end up getting lifetime pensions and benefits.  It should be only a short-term public service that people can do and then they must go.  It's unfair that certain individuals are able to stay in Office for the rest of their lives and still vote on issues that affect the rest of us. The elected officials should be recalled and have their terms limited to no more than two terms in both House and Senate.  The nation as a whole needs to have a system in place whereby the people can elect their own people, put their own Bills up, and have them passed.
67	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about Spaghetti? Quoting the transformers movies is really fun, but it's still just a movie and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can't you people have your own thoughts, or is every post you comment on dependent on popular culture references? I'm sickened by the amount of time I spend looking into these things and I would much rather spend my time exploring something on my own - I feel like I'm missing out on something special. I want to get deeper into the ideas and concepts of a particular thing, not just see a collection of images of a pop culture icon here and there.
68	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us.  Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
69	Depends on your state...Here in Nebraska Legal Majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that support is necessary through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a swift kick in the pants! It is a very difficult thing to deal with...watching your daughter self-destruct but it sounds like you have no choice. IF she was still living with her father you should be giving him money towards her support...if she is "on her own" in her own apartment, you have no obligation to pay an 18yr olds rent.  I would tell her she is on her own...IF she wants to come home and finish High School she can...but if she wants to be a Junkie, that is her decision and she has to bear the financial burden of living on her own.
70	I understand the Democratic Party receives the most money from PACs. As a union guy, our dues are relatively small and the Teamsters and other unions contribute a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians compared to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I believe the ability for unions to fund pro-union politicians would be a good democratic check on the power of capital. When a politician tries to legislate to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to curtail workers' organizations.
71	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore! (This is more appropriate as it does not state that Farquhar is the founder, but simply that he was involved in the settlement of Singapore and was given credit for it.) And I do know that Farquhar had a lot of involvement in the settlement of Singapore, but let me remind you that even though he was "Raffles assistant", he still had to consult Raffles and Raffles had all authority over Singapore, so he was given credit for it.
72	EXCUSE ME! wow someone is very agressive...me? nah I tell the truth...17 years old...very athletic...joined the army reserves recently and I'm a straight A student who might occaisonally recieve a B+...so I'm not retarded, which I think being a retard is a very subjective thing to say about yourself. I'm entering my senior year of high school meaning I've had 4 years to study AB Calculus, and I'm incredibly proud to say I'm a student who got a B+ in it!  I'm also taking a 3 unit college physics class and I actually hope to get an A in it.  I think what also makes me unique is that I'm taking a class on digital music production and hope to gain a professional understanding of it as I believe I have the potential to become a proficient composer/producer in the future.  I'm also part of a school production of a 10-minute play and would like to try out for community theatre roles when I have more time.  I really enjoy performing and hope to make a career of it.  On the other hand, I'm not interested in taking part in any activities with a large group of people as I'm just not that type of person - I prefer to focus on my own interests and hobbies, like drawing, taking photos, and playing the guitar.  Although I don't have time for a full-on band, I'm still hoping to be able to make a career out of my music talents.  I'm also hoping to be able to make some money on the side by offering online guitar lessons.  But in the end I'm determined to become a successful professional musician.  I'm also currently in the process of learning a new language - Spanish - which is proving to be a very interesting and rewarding experience.  I'm learning how to write scripts in Spanish, as I believe I have a good potential to become a successful screenwriter.  I hope to one day be able to take a writing trip to Mexico to experience the culture and explore the country.  I'm particularly fascinated by the Mayan ruins there, and I hope to eventually learn to speak the language too.   I also hope to one day be able to make a recording of my own songs - I'm not in a rush, but I believe I have the potential to produce something that people will find interesting.  I'm thinking of making an album that consists of acoustic versions of my songs and some of my own compositions.  I'm still trying to figure out how to use a recording studio, but I'm determined to be able to eventually make a professional-sounding album.  I'm determined to become a successful recording artist.  I also think I have a potential to become a successful film score composer, as I'm interested in exploring the world of film scores and I'm very excited about the idea of being able to contribute to a film with my music.  I believe I have the potential to become a successful film score composer.  I'm currently taking a film scoring course and I hope to become proficient in the field.  I'm also studying music production and looking into the possibility of working on a soundtrack for a movie.  I'm also interested in learning how to use music software and to one day be able to produce something that people will find interesting.  I'm still studying and trying to figure out the technology, but I'm determined to be able to eventually make a professional-sounding album.  I'm determined to become a successful film score composer and eventually be able to make a good living out of my music.  In the future, I'm looking forward to making a living as a composer and/or producer, by taking on freelance jobs and producing soundtracks for video games.  I'm determined to eventually become a successful game score composer.  I'm currently taking a game scoring course and I hope to become proficient in the field.

73	I think the exaggeration of injuries by professional soccer players in order to draw a yellow card is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player is always up running around looking pained after the slightest bump, while in other sports like football, basketball, etc., the players are usually brush off the bump and go right back into the game.  Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer players appear to be overacting more often than not. Change my view.
74	I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness if it does not harm anyone else in the process. Similarly to alcohol, laws should be in place where psychedelics like Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are concerned, where you cannot be tripping in public and such. Scientists are finding that psychedelics are harmful when compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Additionally, they are not addictive either. If they merely improve a user's quality of life and are not addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, I do not believe they should be illegal.  Again, when I refer to psychedelics, I am referring to the ones that are harmless and non-addictive. nBOMe's and other more harmful substances should not be legalized.
75	If that was the entire story, then the outcome was a bit unfair. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a "bad" place, which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street.   What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on not having any knowledge of the situation - he was just walking his dog. There was no need for any trials or arrests.   And how is an innocent person forced to register as a sex offender? That scenario seems really unfair as it could happen to anyone.
76	In the public eye, Iraq does not deserve freedom the same way we do. We need to keep fighting the terrorists for the people of Iraq from the terrorists who rule it. We are not a dictatorship, we are a democracy who fight for FREEDOM, JUSTICE, and DEMOCRACY. Unfortunately, the people voted in a way that is not democratic - the results were based on religion and the religion was not decided by the people. The government is supposed to be based on laws, not on religion.  finally, for the budget, we get the results from the election. The money from the state and local level budget and grants are allocated differently based on the needs of the people.  Iraq needs a democracy to be established and elections need to be held in order to decide the future of the country in a democratic way.   Finally, for the economy, Iraq needs to be able to manage its own economy and to be able to have control over its own financial situation. The economy and taxes are highly dependent on the state and local level, and the local government is able to generate income based on the area's needs.  In other countries, the economy is controlled by the central government and they get funding from the central government based on the population of the area.

For Iraq to have control over the production and export of the oil and gas, it needs to have control over the regulation of the resource.  }  Finally, Iraq needs to be able to regulate the exports of the oil and gas reserves.

77	Definately, the egg and spoon race is a wicked idea! And maybe we should have the royal family breed up a few more uinterbred little kids to partake in the warfare. Imagine them up against the vodka drinking russians.  I reckon there would be <if there were no ewapons> fewer opportunities for hostility to break out.  Without weapons, there'd be less chance of a mass brawl. And, in places where they're in abundance, less calm areas of the world. But at least all the fighting would be confined to one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it if they didn't want to.  I would say though, that if it wasn't for the uinterbred little kids of war, there would be more peace in the world. The warfare they bring to online gaming adds a level of aggression that otherwise would not be present. It's interesting to see how a tense situation can be diffused when no weapons are involved - with some of the players not wanting to take part in the warfare at all, instead opting for calmer pursuits.

79	It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business because he doesn't have to, as a father. He also wont search your room and if he does find something he doesn't like, he will take it to the extreme of not telling you that he found it. He might even just trash it. He does not give you the feeling he would be happy to have you if he knew you that he was worried he might lose you. Being a father is a difficult job and it puts a lot of pressure on the kid.   Having a father like this, even though it is not ideal, is still better because he does not physically abuse you but he does emotionally abuse you by not showing his love and support. He is also critical and put you down when you do something and I think it is because he does not feel like he is a part of you.  He will also not take you to do some activities he enjoys with you because he does not feel a connection. He might also be very critical if you want to pursue a hobby that he does not like. He could also be very controlling, which makes me feel like I cannot make my own decisions. > This type of father is actually the best father a kid could have if he does not have a fatherly relationship with him, which is heartbreaking.  It is better to be fatherless than to have a father like this because you won't feel like he is really a part of your life. He is more of a stranger who lives in the same house as you. }
80	CarCraze --- you are right, sorry to say. The Court can order you to appear in court to answer to a Motion to Collect a Debt. It is a Court Order and you need to take action to appear in court, depending on the court's rules. Generally, you will need to file a response with the court providing information such as your address and the date when you can appear in court to answer the motion. If it is on Court paper and has a case number, call the Court to confirm the Docket Number, and find out when the hearing date is.
81	I agree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is not a good idea. One of the reasons they are illegal is that they do harm the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the players' health because they are too young and their career is important. In addition, these athletes serve as role models to many younger kids. Do you want kids to see professionals using these drugs and think that it is okay? This could encourage the use of steroids for younger kids. Not only will you see a rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs in professional players, but in non-professional players as well.  If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, it would cause all athletes to start using them just to stay competitive with the other players.
82	Improper conduct for a judge may be nothing more than a violation of a judicial ethical rule, and could be something as simple as allowing the appearance of impropriety. It can happen where the judge has never broken the law or even nothing ethical -- just the appearance is enough to remove the judge sometimes. But just that appearance is not grounds for forcibly removing an elected official from office.  Improprieties can include financial mismanagement or nepotis hiring, for example.
83	Here's another thing to think about...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliate, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case seperately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that. This can be dangerous, as it could lead to wrong interpretations of the law.
84	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. During her time as prime minister, Britain's old industries suffered greatly and poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her leadership. However, I recently met a person from London who had a positive opinion of her. I find her to be a very divisive figure.
85	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall out of beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.   Cosleeping should never be encouraged as it can be dangerous. Babies can fall out of beds, destroy intimacy in the parent's relationship, and it will be much harder later if the baby falls out. Basinets are a good option as they are small enough to fit nearly anywhere.  Cosleeping should absolutely never be encouraged as a practice, as it can be dangerous and the baby can fall out of the bed, destroying intimacy in the parents' relationship.
86	If you were the dad: You can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.   Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.  Consider if you were able to support the child on your own.  If circumstances change throughout life, that is why this evaluation is in place.   Income evaluation is done based on how much he is making now.   If you were to relocate, the support amount will go down.  If you move further away, the amount owed will go down, as the child support office goes to the new address to verify income.   In some states, if you were to move to another state, the child support office goes to the employer and verifies all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.  Consider if you were able to support the child on your own.  By law, the court can only review income and reevaluate the amount of support per month owed if you move to another state.   If you relocate, the support amount will go down.  If you move further away, the amount owed will go down, as the child support office goes to the new address to verify income.   In some states, if you were to move to another state, the child support office goes to the employer and verifies all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.

87	All we can say is a big IF because India is not yet fully equipped with the potential and capability to lead the world. Who knows maybe in the future India could fail to lead us. Other countries like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan have more technologies, resources and ability than India. India is not yet as advanced in terms of technology. Technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then". **This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc**  In some minimum wage jobs, there is no chance for promotion or raise, but in higher skilled positions such as apprenticeships and internships there is more opportunity for advancement.  Essentially, minimum wage jobs are often just that - minimum wage jobs.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider suicide, they have the strength to live on. It is not something I would personally consider nor do, but if you are able to contemplate it, you have the strength to continue living. Suicide is not something I find necessary. It is more about choosing to live.  Change my view on this topic - if you have the strength to consider killing yourself, you have the strength to live on.
90	In North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, gone to your county's sheriff's office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of whatever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a hand gun? I know other states are even harder to deal with. New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns. The process should be standardized across the country - should individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something straight out of the Constitution.
91	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike".  All it accomplishes is:  * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like they should adhere to these particular values * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society    It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women are not expected to have these values (if they do, they're expected to act more traditionally feminine). This phrase could be used by both men and women, regardless of their gender.  Why not have a gender neutral phrase? "Be a better person"?
92	This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive,  then buy large amounts of it in bulk which would last several meals as a side. A £1/1kg bag of carrots, 80p bag of celery, £1/1kg bag of oats and £75/kg bag of bananas cost less than £4, a good deal for less than £4. If you have a big enough freezer, you can even buy chicken breast in bulk that will last months. This is more cost-effective than buying ready meals at £2 each or worse, buying a £4-7 takeaway (considering the cost, healthy food should be more affordable).
93	Yeah, it's biased.  But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet search records of Americans over to the government in the name of fighting crime?  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the government's agenda.  And it was dumb to pose that question.  It is a crime to threaten the administration, even if you aren't posing any type of protests, and they can delete your questions if they feel like it.  I've noticed that they let a lot of your questions stay, but when it comes to politics they sometimes delete my answers if they don't agree with their political views.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism are not a disease, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD can make you not focus easily, but when you do, you hyper focus and grasp more information. I have friends with ADHD who have forced themselves to focus and have achieved great things and retained more knowledge. Some people with autism can be very skillful, such as in math, science and music. I believe we should allow them to grow and be their own unique, awesome version of humanity advancing us towards the next stage in our history.
95	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other peoples opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.  In many cases it could be conservatism is masquarading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything, but in some cases conservatism can lead to a life being less valued if it isn't necessary for the mother's health or if the child is at risk of having a disability.  Every unborn child has a right to life and bodily autonomy, regardless of whether the mother's health is affected or not.  The point of pro-life is not to oppose every single abortion, but to oppose abortion in certain cases, such as if the foetus has a diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening condition or if the pregnancy is less than 20 weeks.  Abortion is always an option, but it may be an incredibly difficult decision for a woman to make if she is pregnant with a child with a disability.  A similar principle applies if the child has a risk of having a health condition which could make their life difficult.

96	Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured, then killed by other cars passing over it.   My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die is not something anyone should feel emotional about. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another Field. I am a wage earner, I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road.   It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and do not impact our lives in any meaningful way.
97	Three debates in one day criticizing my views on upholding convinceme's seriousness. Convinceme is the ONLY administrator for this website, and he has not posted any rules prohibiting the types of debates that I would like to take part in. I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community. I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily run over by repeat participants, as I feel the community is deserving of better input.  Three debates in one day cemented my suspicions that convinceme was intending to not flag anything, just as I felt he was not eager to stop me when I was engaged in a debate that seemed to him to have taken a point too far. I felt he was not as responsive as he could have been, and I was left with the sense that he was not as interested in the substance of the debates as he was in maintaining the form of the website.  I'm not here to simply accumulate votes, but believe that the type of debate I am interested in takes this website to a higher level. three debates in one day when I was inclined to believe that convinceme was less than enthusiastic about what I was doing.  I believe the community is worthy of better input, as long as I have the freedom to choose what I participate in. Three debates in one day confirmed for me that I would prefer not to be subject to the same topics over and over.  I'm interested in more diverse topics and the type of debates that I would like to take part in should not just be limited to matters of convinceme's choice, but I feel that the community is deserving of having a wider range of topics to choose from. Three debates in one day that have been of interest to me are those which involve substantive exchanges between different participants.  For me, it is more interesting to participate in debates where people have taken a stand on the issues and defended their points of view rather than those which are just voting practices.  I appreciate the deeper interactions which occur in the latter type of debate, as I feel the community is more deserving of such exchanges. Three debates in one day were more meaningful to me when the content was on more serious matters than just voting on a scale.  I feel the website should be given a wider scope to choose from when it comes to topics. Three debates in one day I'm interested in involve matters that are meaningful to me, not just those that involve convinceme's choice.)
98	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will definitely press for the Death penalty. But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the Glaring eyes & stance when in court he recently told the judge, "I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?"  The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddams case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts?  No. The chair will probably decay & break, and the switches/wires will rust or melt away. If the trial takes place in a Court where Saddam has to appear in person, it will be even more tricky due to the security measures. Saddam has much more influence over the result, as he is able to decide where the trial is held and the way the trial is conducted. He has rejected several locations & venues so far. Saddam is also likely to be very changeable in court, resulting in a more unpredictable trial.  The important thing is to get a trial which is acceptable to the Iraqis, and it is essential that the whole process is seen to be fair and impartial by the Iraqis. Saddam has been granted several appeals & hearings, and the Iraqi judicial system is still quite young, so the outcome is not always certain. He has also been allowed to choose the type of tribunal (civil court or special tribunal), the venue and the way the trial is conducted. Saddam has also requested to be tried by a judge rather than a jury. }
99	The Cold War is over, there's no more USSR, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, communist and or dictatorship countries. There are many US bases, agricultural and companies wanting to trade with Cuba which will help open Cuban society and US businesses can take hold on the island and increased tourism will make contact with Cubans. It is clear that the current political stance is a failure, after 48 years of this, a new policy should be established. Cuba is a different country now, after so much change in the world, it's time to move on and establish normal relations, trade and travel with Cuba.
