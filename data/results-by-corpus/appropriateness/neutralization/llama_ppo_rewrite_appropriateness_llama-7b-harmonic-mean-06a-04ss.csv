0	The argument that porn can increase one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults is valid. While porn can be addictive, it can also help people develop healthier attitudes towards sex and life in general.
1	No, I haven't yet but (it sounds like it's a friend) and it sounds like she could get help through pro-bono services or legal aid. You would be surprised at what some places consider ‘low income’. My sister's husband brings home at least $400-$600 a week in the winter and at least $600 in the summer months, and they have a three-person household. They receive approximately $46,000 a year and get help from W.I.C., Daycare Assistance, etc.
2	Sadism, defined as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfill some sort of personal or sexual gratification, is in my opinion the most disturbing act a person can commit. As such, it requires a subjugation of the victim, who is weaker than the active participant, thereby compounding the act of violence. Although both participants may be consenting adults, this remains an extreme form of violence, making it particularly heinous.
3	I think we should invest resources into researching animal hybrids, such as a gorilla-octopus hybrid. The face would resemble an octopus and it would have two legs as well as six wavy arms, with a furry coat. Although creating hybrids involves a risk, I believe the result would be worth it.
4	Statistics show that criminals are less inclined to commit crimes when facing an armed citizenry. Gun control laws can reduce access to firearms for potential criminals, but gun control itself is not an effective deterrent to crime. The Second Amendment is there to ensure that citizens have the ability to fight back against a government that may become oppressive. Hunting rifles are no match for machine guns.
5	Being horny is a sin; masturbation is a sin; having sex with your girlfriend is a sin; raping is a sin. Religion teaches that natural feelings are sinful and that sex outside of marriage is sinful, which can lead to a lack of understanding about what is right and wrong in terms of sexual activity.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.).  Additionally, gay women are more “socially acceptable,” for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are seen as inferior to men.  Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is “lowering himself” to a women's level.  Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
7	This is a complex issue and one that requires more investigation than is currently available. While it is undoubtedly true that China has become more restrictive of free expression in recent years, it is also important to remember that the US has its own interests to consider, such as maintaining good economic relations with China. It is also possible that conditions in some Chinese factories are indeed similar to slavery, although this has not been confirmed. Until more evidence is available, it is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. What is the difference?
9	Life is not always fair, and it is important to learn that our success in life often comes from taking risks and playing to win. We can be compassionate and kind people, but it may not necessarily prevent negative events from happening to us. Similarly, people who take risks and play to win sometimes are successful even though they may not be treated fairly.
10	Scott Peterson's case received a lot of media attention due to the similarities between his case and that of O.J. Simpson. Both crimes involved the murder of the victim's pregnant wife, as well as a subsequent affair between the murderer and an accompanying lover. Despite the similarities, the outcomes of the trials differed significantly, leading to different verdicts. This fascination with these cases could be attributed to the fact that both crimes posed a challenge to societal perceptions of family, and the idea of “the perfect family.”
11	* Hamas has fired over 2000 missiles into Israel in the past two weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to secure a ceasefire.   * Israel has the right to respond with retaliatory attacks to ensure the safety of its citizens. Although Hamas is trying to maximize civilian casualties by launching missiles from civilian areas, Israel should not be held responsible for these casualties.   * Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas in order to ensure the safety of its citizens, and invasion of Gaza is a viable option to prevent further bombings.
12	I believe the government should simply record marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to all couples. As for polygamous unions, they exist but are not widely accepted by the population. That is a separate issue for another day; the issues are quite distinct. In my mind, marriage or civil unions provide stability and support to families, especially when they are raising children. Many gay couples have strong monogamous relationships, and they are excellent parents too.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment can be uninspiring. After three years, I have realized that everyone is just passing through, with the feeling that no one notices or cares about their work or the subject they are studying. It seems like universities are not here to serve humanity, but instead focus more on the corporate world.
14	Bad Company 2 has a slightly different gameplay style than Call of Duty; it focuses more on tactical gameplay and teamwork, rather than solo shooting. The controls can take some getting used to, but the vehicles are more interesting to control than in other games of the same genre. The maps are slightly larger than in other games, but it makes the game more exciting since you have to constantly look for enemies.   Call of Duty: World at War has a larger map than Battlefield: Bad Company 2, and the gameplay can be more intencis than in BC2. However, the maps in BC2 are big enough to make the game more interesting.   Compared to Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Modern Warfare 2 provides more intense gameplay due to its more interesting situations - enemies can ambush the player from different directions, while the player has to defend themselves or look out for enemies around the corner.   In BC2, the gameplay may seem boring at first since you don't always know where the enemies are, but it makes the game more interesting since you need to search for them.  In comparison, MW2 offers more exciting gameplay due to the unexpected threats the player has to anticipate.
15	I often hear people discussing the death penalty and whether it should be enforced more often. Personally, I am still undecided on this issue. However, if executions are used to serve as a form of societal retribution, as I believe they are, it would be beneficial for society to see what happens to the convicted when a death sentence is handed down. This could help spread information about what executions in the United States are like, which could alter beliefs about the death penalty.
16	Democracy requires the consent of the people and cannot be imposed from the outside. Muslim countries lack the Enlightenment background that the US had when forming its constitutional republic. In Islam, the state and religion are combined, with the rule of law coming from the Quran. It will take a long period of its own enlightenment for western democracy to have a chance of succeeding. Until then, military control is the only option, which could lead to blowback as seen in the Middle East.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous if you get caught as the penalty can be severe. However, people tend to bend laws and break laws as the penalty is not severe, such as speeding or not wearing seat belts. Any law is right if it does not infringe upon human rights and religious beliefs. If you are unhappy with any law, you can challenge it in the court of law or ask your legislature to amend it. It is a tedious process.
18	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk. Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets, which is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him enrages him, as well as the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head compared to his paltry 100 lbs. This makes me win the majority of the battles. Optimus Prime is very powerful, but the Hulk stands a better chance of defeating him.
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).    The argument is that it's considerate to put the seat down after use, however it's the men who are expected to carry out this task as well as the women, which can be inconvenient in certain scenarios. The argument does not take into account that women might be more affected by the possibility of a urine splash than men, as men might be more likely to urinate in a urinal which could be shared between men and women.
20	You are right that the government of Maharashtra imposed a ban on ladies bars; this was due to complaints from housewives about the activities in these bars and the potential for criminal activities taking place there. The government was concerned about the potential for male family members wasting money on these bars and not looking after their families.
21	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, and this has always been the case. I have no issue with two people living together in a sinful relationship, but I do not think they should be rewarded with tax breaks. Additionally, I do not want my children to be exposed to this lifestyle and have it become normalized in our society, as this could lead to a breakdown in morality.
22	I agree that the Stormcloaks are presented as the antagonists in the questline and are the clear antagonists of the civil war in Skyrim, which does weaken the story in that it gives no complexity to the conflict. However, I believe that there is still tension and conflict between the two sides, making the story engaging despite the lack of complexity of the conflict. Additionally, I argue that the Stormcloaks are presented as the villains primarily because of their actions, such as their racism and abuse of those different from them, which paints them as the villains in the game's moral universe.
23	According to a recent report, 50% of the scientists at NASA are Indian IITians. Imagine what would happen if these scientists join ISRO – India’s status, knowledge and astronomical knowledge would certainly increase.  India is capable of opening hi-tech institutions, however, we are unable to provide them with better job opportunities of their level. This is due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, poor working environment and salary. We need to improve our industrial sector in order to make use of India’s potential.
24	I believe that pornography can be a healthy and consensual part of an adult's life. While porn may be stimulating and erotic for some, there is a clear boundary between fantasy and reality. I watch porn once or twice a day and have a great relationship with my boyfriend, where we incorporate porn into our bedroom activities to spice things up. We are aware of the fact that it is all fantasy and are not idiots, having desires that need to be met.
25	I understand the studies that show young men can be more reckless than women, however, this should not be a reason to treat men differently than women. For example, whites, who make up 78% of the US population, accounted for 35% of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13% of the US population, were 38% of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17% of the US population, were 21% of the state prison population. This indicates that Blacks and Hispanics may be overrepresented in prison more than whites, which may indicate that state and federal governments may have already taken this into consideration when setting insurance rates.
26	Jesus was more of a spiritual leader than a political one, so he did not participate in the political systems of Rome. He primarily preached to the people, sharing his message of hope and love and performing miracles to demonstrate his power as the Son of God. It is also possible that he had long hair because this was the custom of his time period. Additionally, Roman law prohibited Jews from wearing certain types of clothing, such as long hair, which may have been a factor in Pilate's decision to have Jesus scourged rather than sentenced to death. Ultimately, there is not enough evidence to definitively state that Jesus was married.
27	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was originally implemented for 15 years or the implementation of the Mandal commission after several years. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact that there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.  However, there is opposition to reservation due to the fact that the benefits of it are not reaching the actual people in need, rather a few people from these societies who are already part of the upper class have taken up these benefits, while the actual needy have not seen any change. No one will object if a truly needy person gets the benefit.
28	I would say it depends on the country; in some countries, foreigners are welcomed, while in others, it depends on the individual country's culture and history. Generally, if a country has a negative history or experience with a certain country or certain cultures, then its people may be less accepting of them. However, this is not always the case as some countries are more accepting of foreigners than others.
29	Yes, freedom of speech should be of unlimited proportions. While the government should not be able to intervene in terms of what can and cannot be said, it is important to remember that freedom of speech goes hand in hand with personal responsibility and accountability. The cartoonist knew that the cartoons could cause trouble in extremist countries, and while I acknowledge the Islamic world’s reaction, I believe that their actions go too far and do a disservice to their religion. In many countries, Christians do not act with the same level of outrage over similar cases.
30	I understand your point that culture should not be used as an excuse to do something wrong; however, certain aspects of culture can influence behavior, language, and traditions. For example, in some countries, it is more accepted for people to express their emotions in public than in other countries, which can lead to different social norms. We should be respectful of other cultures and acknowledge the uniqueness of each culture, while also ensuring that we understand and respect the customs and traditions of the places we visit.
31	I don't think its a waste of time but I think it is pointless because our world (Earth) has its own bigger problems such as world poverty, population growth, pollution, and the biggest threat - global warming. Scientists should focus on addressing our world's problems first and try to make them livable, instead of trying to make other planets inhabitable. There is a possibility that we will be unable to do so and everyone will die due to the scientists' efforts.
32	I believe that it should be up to the property owners whether smoking is allowed or not. Here in Ohio, most places are non-smoking, so I have not had an issue with smoke bothering me. However, if smoke-free laws are put in place, it can be difficult to enforce them, which can lead to problems. Bars in particular may be affected by this, which could be an issue for patrons.  This could lead to an increase in costs for the “clean air fund”, so if smoking is banned, funds could be used to help support this.  If this passes, it could limit people’s choices on where they can smoke.
33	I can understand why this situation may have garnered less public attention than the Schiavo case; Schiavo's case was more high-profile and controversial. However, I think the fact that the woman was allowed to die with her family present is a positive outcome, and it is encouraging that her privacy was respected in such a difficult situation.
34	The US has one of the strongest navies in the world, with 366 military ships in commission and 4 military ships in the area facing pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover thousands of nautical miles and it is questionable if 4 ships can adequately protect the area.  Given the US's military strength, more ships should be deployed to protect the trade routes and countries in the area, or better yet, more ships should be deployed to guarantee the security of the area. Allowing trade routes to be dangerous and hostile is not politically correct, and the US should take a more proactive approach to protect these areas.
35	While it is important to provide guidance to children and teens about the consequences of sexual activity, ultimately, parents and guardians should give their children the information and support they need to make their own decisions. It is also important to impart values and teach responsibility to children as they grow.
36	The establishment of a Jewish state was sometimes seen as necessary to provide safety to Jewish people, who were scattered around the world. To the victors go the spoils; Israel being established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location could have been prevented. An alternative would have been to annex a portion of Germany, relocate the population and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their holy land. I am aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis; however, annexing a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than creating a new state in Palestine based on a religion-based claim.
37	I understand the concerns raised by proposed laws named after a person; however, I believe that any law should have safeguards and rational provisions to ensure that any prohibited action is more than just a potential threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal based on the potential for combining with other actions, rather than on concrete evidence of potential harm. This can limit both freedom and autonomy, which I feel should be done only when necessary.
38	Oh lol. People have different beliefs and faith is based on personal experiences and feelings, not proof. Atheism is also a belief that requires faith. Both sides contradict each other, and no one truthfully wins. Christianity is my faith choice because of my own experiences and feelings. Atheism is not necessarily true, since proof of God's existence is still a matter of debate.
39	I am pro-choice and I understand why a woman would choose to have an abortion in certain situations, but personally I do not believe it is morally right. I believe that every woman has the right to make their own decisions, but I think that abortion carries too many risks and is not the ideal option. Ultimately it is up to the individual and their decision should be respected.
40	ethically, if your father's insurance goes up, you should pay it. It will probably be reviewed within six months. Though the good news is that you are likely insured under your father's policy as a secondary driver, your friend may have to pay out of pocket if there is a large claim as he was not listed as a separate driver on the policy.
41	I understand that family is important and that my parents think I should make an effort to get along with them. However, I don't feel that way at all. I feel that it is my choice if I want to care about them or not, and I don't want to.
42	Dear Friend,  I agree that racial profiling is an issue, but I believe that insurance companies have the potential to charge different rates for different demographics than law enforcement, as insurance companies have the ability to charge different rates based on factors such as driving record, location, etc. while law enforcement does not have the same capacity.  Insurance companies are also able to sell insurance, which is different than law enforcement, which has the ability to send people to jail or prison.  Therefore, I believe that law enforcement is able to have more of an impact than insurance companies when it comes to discrimination.
43	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multitask by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit when I pissed. Over time, I began to do it more often. Now I multitask quite often by sitting while I piss while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to piss when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it about half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean that it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with sexuality at all.
44	Firstly, does your bf own the company or is he a worker?  Unless he has done something to cross a picket line, it is unlikely that he will be disliked or resented by the union.  Unions typically only form when employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting their contributions.  Unionism grows when employees feel that management is not doing so.  This could lead to labour peace if both sides are respectful of each other.  However, if management and union posture themselves in an adversarial way, this could impede any labour peace.
45	Throughout the debate over the Washington Redskins name, I have often heard the argument that having a team named the Washington Redskins is equivalent to having a team named the Detroit N***s. This, to me, is illogical; the word Redskin is not used in the same way as the N word in everyday language, and the two terms are not on the same level in terms of usage.
46	I feel that it is better to prioritize personal pursuits. While it is important to help others if needed, you will always choose to help a family member first, as that is the stronger bond. It is more natural to help a family member in need before a stranger.
47	There is no provision in either the Declaration of Independence or the United States Constitution which states that the government having access to all the fruits of our earnings is part of freedom.  However, the Declaration of Independence states that the “the right of the people to keep and bear arms for self-defense” is part of the “self-evident truth” that all people are endowed with certain unalienable rights.  The Constitution, meanwhile, establishes the right to a jury trial in criminal cases and provides Congress with the power to levy taxes.  The Founding Fathers believed strongly in the importance of taxation for the common good, as the colonies did in Virginia.  Our Constitution has since been amended to allow for income taxes.  Our Founding Fathers thus intended for income taxes to be constitutional and part of the government’s authority over taxation.  Thus, income taxes are not prohibited by the Constitution.  Finally, the Constitution also prohibits any taxation without representation, indicating that the Founding Fathers never intended to oppose all taxation.  The Founding Fathers were rather supportive of taxation as a means of financing the government and providing infrastructure and services.
48	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's important to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments collect taxes from us, and then use the fruits of their taxation to build infrastructure and provide services.  While the government does not necessarily need our consent to do so, we have a right to know what is going on.
49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but some are harder to convince due to their faith in the government. This faith prevents them from believing that their government could orchestrate the murder of its citizens. It will take time for them to come around to this reality. In the meantime, if the country were to become occupied by the military, with curfews and other restrictions in place, the worst-case scenario could occur.
50	Installation art is a genre of art that seeks to engage and interact with its viewers by involving the physical environment. However, it has become increasingly popular for galleries to exhibit art that does not challenge the traditional definitions of art, but instead reinforces them. Unfortunately, this repetition of Duchamp's Fountain has resulted in a lack of interest and excitement amongst the general public. It is fair to say that installation art has become increasingly monotonous, to the point where it is difficult to find engaging pieces. This is a great shame, as art should always be able to intrigue and captivate its viewers.
51	Yes, the president should be impeached. Bush has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, which is a serious offense. We need to have better leadership in the United States to address the current situation. Therefore, the Congress should vote to impeach Bush.
52	At Poland Spring, we carefully monitor our water quality at every stage of the bottling process. Our rigorous quality control standards ensure the same purity and consistency of our water throughout production. Our multi-barrier filtration system is complemented by carefully monitored disinfection processes and testing for over 200 contaminants, far more than state and federal regulations require.
53	Do you want to have contact with your children? You have legal rights to have contact with them unless a court finds you unfit. You need to enforce these rights in court. Doing this could be difficult if you do not live in the jurisdiction of the latest court order. It is important to fight for this contact. Your children need to be able to maintain a relationship with their father.
54	I believe the majority of poor Americans are often content to stay in their current situation, as they do not have to take on additional responsibilities, such as college or work, which could improve their lives. Many feel that they are entitled to rely on the government or social programs for their livelihood, rather than take on the challenge of improving their situation. I understand that our society has created this opportunity, but it is important to remember that the world we have created has made us soft.
55	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, but I do believe that climate change is happening slower than what the media suggests. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is largely driven by environmental lobbyists and politicians who seek to gain more control and funding. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me and is knowledgeable in the science.
56	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, it is possible that we could create another sentient life form which could reach the same level as us, including creating more sentient life forms. However, this would only be the case if it were to do so at the same rate, otherwise it could be faster or slower than us, and thus be greater or inferior than us. This would depend on the rate of our creator, rather than just ourselves. Therefore, it is possible that this could happen, but only if our creator allows it.
57	I understand that there may be some confusion over whether you have a case or not. Generally, in order to have a workers' compensation case, you must submit an accident report and provide proof of the injury occurring on the job site. Additionally, your employer must sign an affidavit stating that you were injured while on the job. This can be difficult to prove if there is not enough evidence to support it.
58	Yes, marijuana laws in the US need to be reformed. While it may have been illegal in the past, it does not necessarily make it wrong. Regulations should be changed to reflect the current understanding of the risks and benefits of marijuana use. This would provide a better balance between regulation and access to the drug. Additionally, marijuana laws need to be more closely aligned with other drugs to prevent unequal enforcement.
59	I attended a lecture yesterday that discussed these statistics. Our crime rate is going down, but our incarceration rate is going up, which reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s and early 80s (Reagan mainly). It is important to look at the crime rates of all these countries in order to understand these numbers better. African-American incarceration rates are even worse, with around 6,000 per 100,000.
60	When deciding whether criminals should be allowed to vote, it is important to consider whether an individual is genuinely reformed, and whether they can be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, they could mature and learn to channel their views in a positive way over time. In this case, they should be allowed to vote. Similarly, those who have committed violent crimes such as rape, murder and hate crimes should not be allowed to vote, especially if they are repeat offenders.
61	I lived in Austin from 2000 to 2007 and had access to Rudy's. I loved their brisket and sauce, as well as their gas station set-up and the fact that they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to Phx for 4 years and then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio is where I am now and yes, we have Rudy's, but they're not as accessible as they were in ATX. I've only been once in the past 2 years, when I went on a weekend trip to Phx. Low and behold, there was a Rudy's on the way! My friend had never been and I insisted we go. Unfortunately, she wasn't a fan of the sauce, which was too peppery for her. I, on the other hand, still loved it. I especially enjoyed the potato/egg/cheese taco with the sauce. Delicious! I'm sure I'll be able to visit Rudy's again before I move back to CT, but it was a nice last taste of Rudy's before I leave.
62	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in any way affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why do some people have such strong feelings against them? If two people love each other, they should be able to be together. God accepts everyone, and his people should follow that. Bottom line, marriage should be an option for all couples who want it.
63	It is a difficult issue, as abortion is a highly contentious subject. On one hand, abortion is the option of choice for many women, as it gives them control over their bodies and reproductive decisions. On the other hand, some people feel that abortion goes against their religious or moral beliefs, as the fetus is considered a living form with potential for life. Ultimately, this decision should be left to the woman in consultation with her doctor and family, as it is an intimate and personal decision between a woman and her doctor.
64	I understand the concern about the suffering of the fish, however, I do not think catch and release fishing is necessarily immoral. It is difficult to know the exact level of suffering the fish experience during catch and release fishing; as anglers, we have to make a judgement call about the amount of suffering that is tolerable. While it is likely that fish experience suffering during these events, there may be other factors such as the adrenaline rush of being caught that reduce the level of suffering. As anglers, we must judge these scenarios on a case by case basis.   The same is true for the use of bait fish; while using bait fish to catch larger fish may increase the chance of success, it does involve the death of the bait fish and the anglers must weigh the level of suffering of the bait fish against the potential success of the catch. Again, it is difficult to judge these scenarios without being there and we must make a judgement call.
65	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. These areas have thriving economies and job markets, as well as vibrant cultural scenes. For example, the Orlando area is home to the largest theme park in the world, as well as a renowned technology and engineering university. The Tampa area boasts a popular aquarium, as well as a booming financial and health services industry. Additionally, Miami is a hub for art and fashion, as well as a leading center for international trade and finance.
66	We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there who have been in office for decades, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate.   Getting good people into Congress is difficult as it can be hard to get Bills passed, with legislators needing to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System, that is.  This makes it difficult for new legislation to get through.  We need to break this system to give Congress more power and make it work better for us.
67	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments that I cannot always understand. People quoting pop culture references? Karma is spilling over and overflowing, as original thoughts seem to be dependent on other people's ideas and interpretations. It's frustrating. Can't we have more of our own thoughts and ideas? I believe that ideas should be celebrated and encouraged, especially in an era of technology where information is shared more easily than ever before.
68	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us.  Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  We can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
69	The answer depends on the state, as some states set the legal majority age at 18 while others set it at 19. In some cases, support may be required until the child reaches the age of emancipation, which varies by state but is usually the age of 18 or 19. However, in general, parents are not obligated to pay for an 18 year old’s rent if they are living independently.
70	I understand that labor unions are able to use PACs during election season, while corporations are unable to use such vehicles. Unions are able to provide smaller sums of money to politicians compared to corporations. However, I believe this is a fine democratic check to the power of capital, as it allows unions to fund politicians who might be pro-union. It reminds me of laws which restrict my right to assemble and air grievances, similar to those in state socialist countries.
71	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO “DISCOVERS” A PLACE. While it is true that discovering a place does not necessarily make someone the founder, the fact that Farquhar took an active role in helping to establish Singapore gives him credit as a founder.
72	Yes, people can be hesitant about using online media due to safety concerns, especially when it comes to teens using social media. While it is important to be aware of potential risks associated with using social media, it can also be a great way to stay connected and express oneself. There are measures that can be taken to ensure online safety, such as setting parental controls, limiting the amount of time spent on social media, and teaching children to be aware of the risks.
73	I understand your point that soccer players should not exaggerate injuries, and that legit injuries should be punished. However, if an injury occurs, players usually need a few moments to assess the situation and determine whether or not they can continue playing. It is understandable that they take a few moments to recover and return to the game.
74	I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness, especially if it does not harm anyone else in the process. Laws should be in place to protect people from harm, and these laws should be similar to those regarding alcohol, where use in public is prohibited. Research has shown that psychedelics such as psilocybin (shrooms) and LSD are relatively safe when compared to other drugs, as they are not addictive and do not appear to cause any long-term physical or mental harm. Furthermore, these drugs are usually not considered as harmful as legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco.
75	If that is the entire story, then the outcome is not necessarily accurate. Touching another person can be done in a variety of places, and the Court should take into account the context and intent of the contact. If there was the potential for harm, then the father was right to intervene. The mother should have also talked to the daughter about safe practices, and the father should have discussed the dangers of running into the street. That would have been a more appropriate outcome.
76	How do we get our freedom? We obtain it through standing up and fighting for it. We cannot simply give it to other countries, as freedom is something that must be fought for and defended. We need to continue to fight for the people of other countries in order to provide them with the same freedoms that we have.
77	Yes, the egg and spoon race is an excellent idea! And maybe if there were no weapons, there would be less control over the masses, which is a good thing. There would simply be calm and non-violent areas of the world, rather than conflict zones. This could be beneficial, as the sophisticated people could live in peace and the more aggressive elements would be contained in one area. It could lead to less overall conflict.
78	Gay marriage is a fundamental right that couples should have, regardless of their sexual orientation. People should not be denied the right to marry and have their relationship recognized simply due to their sexual orientation. Everyone should have the right to experience and express love, which is a fundamental human right. Despite any personal discomfort, gay couples should be granted the same legal protections and recognition as any other couple.
79	Having a lousy father can be a difficult experience, as the child may feel like they are not supported or able to make their own decisions. However, at least with a lousy father, the child has a parental figure to turn to for guidance and support. Without a father at all, the child may feel more isolated and may not have the same sense of stability or support.
80	CarCraze --- It is indeed possible that the collection firm may have the power to amend the notice of motion, as the courts have the ability to enforce judgments. It is advisable to contact the court to confirm the docket number and hearings date to ensure the validity of the notice.
81	I agree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs in proffesional sports is an unwise idea. These drugs can have adverse effects on the body, and it is in the government's interest to protect athlete's health as they are still growing. Additionally, these drugs can easily cause an increase in usage among younger athletes, who look up to these players and want to compete. Allowing these drugs to be legalized would also lead to their usage in both proffesional and non-professional players.
82	In some cases, such as when a judge has violated a judicial ethical rule or has allowed the appearance of impropriety, removal from office may be allowed. However, in most cases, removal is only allowed if the official has actually done something illegal, usually at a felony level.
83	Here's another thing to consider...while some judges can be bought, that isn't the biggest issue. The philosophy of being a judge is to be impartial and hear each case separately, without letting their political views enter the courtroom. However, some judges, especially a few new Supreme Court Justices, go beyond that and feel they have the power to 'change' the world according to their own beliefs. That can be a real problem.
84	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike, she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners, which caused massive public outcry. Her time as Prime Minister saw the closure of many of Britain's traditional industries, leading to an increase in poverty in Wales, Scotland and the North of England. People I know from these areas have a strong hatred of her. However, I recently encountered a man from London who stated that he believed she was a great leader and that she was known as the “Iron Lady”. This opinion surprised me.
85	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies can fall out of the bed. Having a baby in the same room makes breastfeeding easier, but it can disrupt the parents' intimacy. It may be more difficult to stop later if you allow it in the beginning. Basinets are portable and can fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that attach to the bed. Cosleeping should not be encouraged.
86	If you were the dad:  You can always just give extra money that doesn't go through the courthouse.  Child support offices will look at the dad's income and verify it, then reevaluates the amount per month owed.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.  Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job.  It goes by a percentage of his income.
87	India certainly has the potential to lead the world in the future, although at present there are other countries that are more progressive, more literate, and more powerful than India. The US, UK, Russia, and Japan have more advanced technology and infrastructure than India, which could be a potential issue in terms of India's ability to meet the needs of its people. Technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then". **This is true, but minimum wage jobs can offer the potential for advancement, training and other benefits which could make it worthwhile in the long run.**
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider or take their own life, they have the strength to choose to continue living. Suicide is a deeply personal decision and I recognize that it is not necessary in all cases; however, I believe that the person has the agency to make this decision.
90	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county’s Sheriff’s office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many handguns as you wanted off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even harder to deal with. New York is one of the toughest; while the government has the power to create laws concerning guns, it should be determined on a national level, with the right to keep and bear arms being outlined in the Constitution.
91	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To “be a man” you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It’s the male equivalent of “be more ladylike”.    All it accomplishes is:   * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit    * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society     It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren’t supposed to have those values (if they do, they’re told to ‘act like a lady’). And god forbid that men have some values that women are ‘supposed’ to have.  In my opinion, these gender roles are outdated and limit men from expressing their emotions and taking on non-traditional roles in society. It is restrictive and may discourage men from taking on these roles.
92	This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas...  Several kilos of food here for less than £4. If you have a big enough freezer, you can even buy chicken breast in bulk which will last months (£48/10kg here)...Then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat, but I see people do this several times a week.
93	Yahoo! Answers has been known to have political and/or racial bias. This is somewhat concerning, as it could potentially influence how users access information on the platform. It is believed that this bias is a result of the moderators of the platform filtering questions and answers in a way that favors certain political views. This could lead to users not being exposed to different perspectives and ideas, which could limit their understanding of certain topics. While it is natural for any platform to have bias in some form, this could limit user experience and freedom of choice when accessing information on Yahoo! Answers.
94	I believe ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism can be an advantage rather than a disability. ADHD allows one to quickly focus and absorb information, which enables them to achieve outstanding results in academics. Additionally, some autistic people are able to be serving forces in their community, generally in math, science, or music, which is remarkable. In my opinion, we should enable these children to grow and reach their full potential.
95	Just like the rest of us, humans have developed opinions on moral, social and legal issues through a mixture of other people's perspectives. This can lead to inconsistencies in our views. It is difficult to reach a conclusion on any issue entirely independently.
96	Today a cat passed away on a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured, then killed by other cars passing over it.  My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I understand her feeling as it is sad to witness an animal suffering, but I personally did not feel anything. Seeing an animal die is not something we should feel emotionally attached to as it is simply another organism dying and it has no real impact on our environment.
97	I believe that debates should be posted according to a set of guidelines for the community’s benefit. It is necessary to declare these guidelines so that members are aware of the parameters of what is accepted and what is not. This will help maintain the integrity of the website and its community.
98	The US, and some of its allies, would prefer that Saddam Hussein is given the death penalty if he is found guilty. However, this decision lies with the Iraqi tribunal and it is unclear what the outcome will be. Saddam Hussein is still seen as a powerful figure by many Iraqis, which could influence the tribunal's decision. Additionally, the situation in Iraq is complex and it is difficult to predict what will happen in the future.
99	The Cold War is over, there's no more USSR, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, communist and dictatorship countries. There have been positive changes in some of these countries, such as greater contact with the outside world, increased tourism, and even American businesses setting up in some places. The US should move on from the current policy, which has failed to bring change after 48 years. A new approach should be implemented to allow normal relations, trade, and travel between the US and Cuba.
