0	Porn can be a slippery slope and can lead to negative consequences such as feelings of guilt, wasted time and energy, and regrets. While it may provide a realistic view of sexual activity, it is important to consider the potential risks before engaging in it. Therefore, it is best to exercise caution and be mindful of the possible risks involved.
1	No, I haven't but it sounds like she may be able to access assistance through pro bono legal services or low income-based legal services. You would be surprised at what some places consider low income - my sister's husband earns a weekly income of $400-$600 in the winter and $600 in the summer, which is enough to bring home approximately $46,000 a year. This income level enables them to access assistance from WIC, daycare subsidies and other support. She may be able to access some of these services, so it is worth investigating.
2	Sadism, in which one person derives pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on another, is an extreme and serious form of violence which can have significant and long-lasting psychological and physical effects on victims. While some acts of sadism may occur between consenting adults, it is still an abhorrent act that can cause immense harm, regardless of the participants’ level of consent. It is important to recognise that these acts can occur within a sexual context and can have serious and long-lasting consequences.
3	I think research into combining animals could be beneficial and worth the cost. For example, a gorilla/octopus hybrid could offer unique characteristics from both parent species, and it could be an exciting and interesting creature to observe. While the potential risk of harming animals should be taken into consideration, the potential benefits of creating these combinations could also be worth it.
4	Gun control can be an effective way to reduce crime as it limits access to firearms for potential criminals. While some may argue that criminals will find other weapons, statistics show that gun control does reduce crime rates as criminals are less likely to engage in criminal activity when up against an armed citizen. This suggests that gun control can be an effective method to protect citizens and reduce crime.  In addition, the Second Amendment was incorporated to the states to allow citizens to bear arms in order to provide a check against a potential tyrannical government. Thus, gun control can provide an important layer of safety that should not be overlooked.
5	Being horny is a natural feeling, and while it may create a temptation to engage in certain activities, it does not make the activities themselves wrong. Teaching young people about morality can be difficult without a shared understanding of right and wrong, which is why it is important to provide a base of knowledge and education which allows individuals to make informed decisions. Religion can be a powerful influence in teaching morals, and it is important to recognize the different beliefs and values of different cultures when discussing these topics.
6	In a society that is traditionally and, to be honest, still patriarchal, lesbians may experience less stigma and discrimination than gay men due to the presence of a woman in the relationship. This is because, in the traditional gender dynamics, women are seen as inferior to men. Thus, lesbians may be more accepted by straight people than gay men. This is likely due to the societal expectation that a woman’s romantic interest should be for another woman rather than a man. Gay men, however, often face discrimination due to the societal expectation that men should be interested in women. Thus, gay men can experience more discrimination than lesbians.
7	This is a sensitive topic that requires careful consideration. While it is true that the Chinese government can be oppressive to those who question its policies, it is important to consider the potential implications of interfering in its affairs. The United States may have reasons for avoiding direct involvement in the country, and it is essential to understand both sides of the story in order to reach an informed opinion.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. We can never know the full story behind the cartoons and the reactions to them, but it is important to remember that both sides can be affected by these situations, regardless of the cause. While both sides are equally upset, it is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that all lives should be respected and not just the Muslims specifically.
9	Life can be difficult and unpredictable, and it is important to prepare for the unexpected. While it may be true that some people take risks and are willing to take the necessary steps to be successful, there is no guarantee of success regardless of how one approaches life. Everyone should strive to take risks and do their best, as different experiences and outcomes can arise depending on an individual's circumstances.
10	Scott Peterson's case received a lot of media attention primarily because of the similarities between his case and that of O.J. Simpson’s. Both cases featured a white defendant, a crime involving a death of a pregnant wife and an accomplice. The public was highly interested in the outcome of both trials due to the sensational nature of the cases. Furthermore, the media attention provided greater insight into the legal proceedings, allowing the public to better understand the differences and similarities between the two cases.
11	* Hamas has launched hundreds of missiles into Israel over the past two weeks, despite numerous ceasefire attempts from Israel. This aggression leaves Israel with limited options to protect its citizens and ensure security.   * Hamas’ aim of completely destroying Israel makes it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself in order to guarantee the safety of its citizens. Israel must be allowed to take action to minimize civilian casualties caused by Hamas, while still effectively targeting the group’s attacks.   * While Israel must be allowed the right to protect its citizens, the deliberate targeting of civilians by Hamas is equally as concerning and must be addressed. Both sides must ensure that civilians are protected, and Israel must be able to take the necessary steps to do so.
12	This debate has clarified for me that the government should not play a role in defining or restricting who can marry. Instead, I believe that churches should be allowed to perform marriages for whomever they deem fit and the government should merely record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to all. With regards to plural marriages, these are rare but do exist. This is an issue that deserves more attention and should be discussed further as it is different from same-sex marriage. In my opinion, the purpose of marriage or civil union should be to provide security to families, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay and they are some of the best parents as well.
13	I believe that universities can be very impersonal and lack inspiration. Students tend to become focused on simply completing their courses without truly engaging with the material. This can lead to a feeling of numbness and lack of connection to the subject matter, resulting in a sense of apathy towards the course. It is important to have engaging educators and course material to keep students motivated and engaged in their studies.
14	Bad Company 2 and Call of Duty: World at War offer unique experiences. While Battlefield offers larger maps and a slower pace, Call of Duty offers a more intense experience with its smaller maps. The maps in Call of Duty force players to be more tactical and reactive to enemy movement, making the gameplay more intense.   In Bad Company 2, the enemies can be more difficult to find as they can hide in cover or pop out from behind obstacles. This can lead to a slower pace of gameplay. Conversely, in Call of Duty players usually have a better idea of where the enemy is, as the maps are smaller and players can more easily anticipate the enemy’s movements.  In the end, each game offers its own unique experiences, so it is up to personal preference which gameplay style a player prefers.
15	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my opinion, it serves an important purpose in providing justice to the perpetrator and providing closure to the victims’ families. Though it is important to maintain a sense of privacy and respect for the victims, I believe that making executions more visible could help to inform the public and change some perceptions of the death penalty.
16	Democracy and western values are important for countries in conflict as a foundation for long-term stability. While some countries may not have the same Enlightenment background as western nations, democracy can still work if there is enough popular support. Muslim countries may not have the same legal and constitutional frameworks as western countries, but democracy can still provide a viable solution if the cultural and religious foundation is there. The West has had success in establishing democracies in some countries, and it is important to remember that these democracies require active, long-term engagement and support to be successful. This can be a difficult process, but it is necessary to provide stability in these countries.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates an individual’s rights can be seen as morally wrong. However, it is important to consider the impact of any law on other people’s rights and freedoms as well as one’s own. Breaking a law can be dangerous as it could lead to penalties, so it is important to consider the severity of the penalty before deciding to break a law. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide whether they are willing to take the risk. It is important to remember that laws can be challenged in court if someone feels they are being violated. In some cases, it may be possible to change or modify the law through legislative action.
18	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets, making him a formidable opponent for any adversary. This is why Thoughtprocess is able to remain victorious despite the disparity in strength. Therefore, in a battle royal, the Hulk would likely prove to be the victor.
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).    It is understandable that both parties should take responsibility for the toilet seat, and ideally this would be discussed and agreed upon between the two. Although this can be difficult to manage, it is still important to try and maintain the balance. Therefore, it may be better to compromise on the issue with each other, rather than expecting one gender to handle it alone.
20	You are incorrect; while Maharashtra has implemented a ban on ladies bars, it is not limited to that state. The Indian government has implemented a ban in order to curtail criminal activities that have been associated with these establishments. This includes complaints from family members of mens' involvement with these bars, as well as the criminal activities that take place. This is likely done with the intention of safeguarding both male and female customers. It is important to remember that these measures are in place in order to ensure a safer environment for everyone.
21	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, but same-sex marriage is becoming more and more accepted by society and laws are increasingly recognizing it. While I believe that same-sex relationships are morally acceptable, I also understand the need for the law to support them in order to ensure equality. However, I do not think that tax breaks should be given to all couples without consideration of their individual circumstances. This can help ensure that everyone is treated fairly while also providing needed support to couples. In the end, I believe this balance can help sustain both marriage equality and overall morality.
22	I agree that the Stormcloaks' actions make them more clearly villainous than the Imperials, as they are willing to resort to extreme measures such as racism and abuse. This does make the Stormcloaks the more obvious 'bad guys' of the conflict and weakens the storyline. However, I would argue that Ulfric's actions with the Thu'um serve to demonstrate his dedication to his cause, rather than making him the villain of the story. While this does make the conflict more complex, it also provides more depth to the story and sheds light on both sides of the conflict.
23	According to a recent report, 50% of the scientists in NASA are Indian IITians. If India were to equip itself with more advanced technological knowledge, it would be able to further increase its standing in the world. India’s education system produces some of the world’s best and brightest students, as evidenced by those who qualify for IITs. However, many of these students are lost to brain drain as they are unable to find jobs at their level. This is partly due to the lack of suitable industrial development and proper salaries. To address this, India needs to improve its industrial sector. This would allow India to take advantage of the knowledge and expertise of its students.
24	While it is possible for some individuals to develop an addiction to pornography, it is generally much more common in those who are predisposed to such an addiction due to underlying mental health or attachment issues. It is important to be aware of the potential for addiction and to be mindful of your usage so that it does not interfere with your relationships. Having a healthy balance between pornography and real life experiences is important for maintaining a healthy sexual life.
25	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, however it is important to consider the underlying risk factors when considering insurance rates for both men and women. Rates should be based on an individual's driving history and other factors, rather than solely on gender. This is fairer for all genders and provides a more equitable insurance system.
26	So you dispute the testimony of Pontius Pilate and the Jewish leaders? What crimes Jesus supposedly committed is still uncertain, though some sources claim he was accused of claiming to be the king of the Jews, as well as distrupting order within the Temple. There is some evidence to suggest that he may have been seen as a subversive figure. While it is clear that Pilate was reluctant to sentence Jesus due to the political tensions at the time, it is also important to consider the accounts of those who claimed to have seen Jesus after his death, which suggests that he did indeed rise from the dead. While this cannot be proven, it is likely that Jesus was in fact married, though this is not as widely accepted.
27	No matter how it is implemented, reservation can have both positive and negative effects. In India, reservation was initially implemented to provide economic equality and reduce social inequality, however it can also lead to some people taking advantage of the system. This can be seen both in the original 15-year implementation and the later Mandal Commission implementation, as it can benefit those in need while also benefitting some people who are already in a higher social class. It is important to ensure that these benefits are reaching those who need them in order to truly make an impact and reduce inequality.
28	I would say that not all foreigners are necessarily welcomed in Russia, as it depends on the country and the individual's experience. It is understandable why some countries may not receive a positive reception as there are some countries which are not well liked due to the government's actions. This could be seen in the way the government operates and their impact on the country as a whole, leading to a negative perception of some countries.
29	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that should be respected, as it allows for a wider range of expression. While some countries may find these expressions offensive, it is important that these views are still able to be shared in order to maintain the balance between freedom and responsibility.    In addition, it is important to consider the context in which the speech occurs. Every situation is different, and thus the level of responsibility and accountability should vary depending on the circumstances. Ultimately, it is important to acknowledge that both freedom of speech and responsibility should be taken into consideration when assessing these types of situations.
30	I just don't know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people who were born in Latin American countries may have a similar accent when speaking English as they become more comfortable with the language, as Spanish is their native tongue.  However, not all Latinos are the same - Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans have their own unique cultures which should be respected. Culture should not be used as an excuse to break rules or behave inappropriately. Everyone should take responsibility for their actions and learn about the customs and traditions of the countries they visit.  Ultimately, it is important to be aware of the differences between cultures in order to respect them.
31	I believe it is important to explore space as well as focus on addressing the current challenges on Earth. Although these challenges are daunting, it is important to remember that each presents an opportunity to develop innovative solutions. Additionally, working on both simultaneously allows us to maximize our chances of success while minimizing the risk that either effort is unsuccessful. Therefore, I believe that there is value in investing in both areas in order to provide the greatest likelihood of positive outcomes.
32	I believe that the decision should be left up to the property owners, as this allows for a wide range of establishments to cater to their individual customer base. I have yet to be in a place where smoking bothers me as most places are now smoke-free, either by law or by choice. This gives people the freedom to decide how they want their establishments to be run, allowing them to best serve their customers. As for the clean air fund, this could be necessary to provide additional support to ensure that the law is effectively upheld. Ultimately, it is important to ensure that both smokers and non-smokers have the right to enjoy their establishments without compromise.
33	I am grateful that this situation was handled with respect for the woman's autonomy, allowing her to die in privacy and with dignity. While the scenario may not have garnered the same level of media attention as Schiavo's case, the differing circumstances likely meant that it was handled with more sensitivity. While it is unfortunate that this situation occurred without public outcry, it is encouraging to see that some families are able to make the difficult decisions regarding end-of-life care in a respectful manner.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the world and it is understandable why the US may need more ships in the piracy-infested waters. The US currently has 366 military ships in commission and 4 in the area that are vulnerable to pirate attacks. This large area of sea requires the presence of more ships in order to ensure adequate protection.  Rather than rely on 4 ships alone, it may be beneficial to deploy additional ships from the US to ensure that trade routes and coastal countries are safe. This would allow for a greater presence and ultimately provide greater security.  Ultimately, more ships may be necessary to ensure the safety of ships and crews in this area, and it is likely worth the resources to provide the extra protection.
35	Having children learn about sex and its related consequences is important for their health and well-being. While it may be difficult to talk about, it is essential to give young people the information and guidance they need to make safe and responsible decisions. While it is understandable to want to protect children from the risks of sexual activity, banning teenage sexuality altogether is not the answer as it would prevent children from learning about sex in a safe and supportive environment.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to provide a safe haven for Jews following the Holocaust. To the victors go the spoils. While the creation of an independent Jewish state in Palestine may have been controversial, the establishment of Israel in this region was likely the most viable option due to historical and political considerations. Germany, as a country which had a central role in the atrocities of the Holocaust, may have posed a security risk to any newly formed Jewish state. Therefore, the creation of Israel within the borders of Germany may not have been feasible. Ultimately, the creation of Israel provides a safe haven for Jewish people which may have not been possible had it been created elsewhere.
37	I haven't had a chance to research this particular law, but in general I am against laws that criminalize behavior without taking into account the full context of the situation. Laws should be carefully constructed to provide enough protection without infringing on an individual's rights. It is important to consider not only the potential risks but also the potential benefits of any law and its potential effects. In my opinion, it is important to evaluate the law carefully in order to make sure it is the best option. While it is difficult to predict the long term effects of a law, it is important to ensure that the legislators have as much information as possible in order to make an informed decision. Ultimately, it is important to consider both the pros and cons of any law before making a decision.
38	Oh lol. People can have different beliefs, and while some people may believe in God, others may not. It is difficult to prove or disprove the existence of God as it depends on each person's individual faith. Both sides provide compelling arguments, but neither is proven wrong as each side can provide evidence to support their stance. This shows that each belief is subjective and there is no clear-cut answer. In the end, it is up to each person to decide which side of the argument they agree with based on their own beliefs.
39	I believe that every woman has the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion and should feel supported in their decision. It is understandable why many women may feel guilty and ashamed afterwards, as the decision to have an abortion is often an incredibly difficult one to make. While it is not morally right for everyone, it may be the best option for some due to situational factors.
40	ethically, if your father's insurance goes up as a result of the incident, then you should be responsible for paying it. This will likely be assessed within six months. While it is a difficult situation, it is important to remember that these types of incidents can occur.  You may be covered on your father's policy as a named driver, which can offer some peace of mind in these types of situations. Your friend is likely to be liable for the damages as he was at fault, and he may be required to pay some or all of the costs out of pocket. This can be a financial burden for him, and it is important to consider his situation when evaluating the outcome.
41	EDIT: I understand that it can be difficult to maintain relationships with family members that you may not see often. However, it is important to maintain these relationships, as it is likely that you will continue to have a connection with them even if you are not in frequent contact. It may be helpful to have your parents as a bridge between you and the rest of the family, as they understand both sides and can act as a liaison when necessary. This can be valuable to have, as it can reduce tension and help to ensure that everyone's needs are being considered.
42	Dear Friend,  I understand the concern, but I would argue that the difference is that law enforcement is given more power than insurance companies. Police officers have the power to detain and arrest people, which can have a much greater impact on an individual’s life than an insurance company’s decision to charge more for a policy. This makes law enforcement more accountable and subject to greater scrutiny than insurance companies.   In conclusion, while both racial profiling and discrimination can have an impact on people’s lives, the potential for damage is much greater when it comes to law enforcement than insurance companies.
43	I have found that it can be more convenient to sit while I am urinating. This is especially true when I am feeling lazy or when I have morning wood and need to urinate quickly. It does not have to do with my sexuality, and it should be accepted as an alternative way to urinate without having to raise an eyebrow. Therefore, I believe that men should be able to urinate sitting down if they choose to do so without feeling any sort of social stigma.
44	Firstly, does your boyfriend's company have a union or is he an employee?   Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this can be a sensitive topic as both management and employees may feel they are being treated unfairly. Management may try to avoid unions forming and negotiations can become difficult. This can create tension between both parties, so it is important to understand both sides’ perspectives.  It may be beneficial to ensure both sides are being respected and that both parties are being fairly represented.  Ultimately, both management and employees need to be able to have their voices heard.  It is important for both parties to come to an agreement which works for everyone involved.   You know unions only grow when employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting the work that they do.  When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how, as a group.  This can cause a great deal of tension and stress in the workplace and make it difficult to reach an agreement.  Therefore, it is important to find a balance that works for all.
45	Throughout the debate regarding the Washington Redskins name, I often hear the argument that a team name is not equivalent to a team name that could be seen as racist, such as the Washington N******s. While this may be true, it is important to consider how both terms are used in context. While the Redskin name may be more commonly associated with football, it can still be seen as derogatory in some cases due to its use in the same context as the N word.
46	I believe that a personal pursuit is important and should take priority as it allows for a greater sense of autonomy and control. While helping out those close to you is essential, it is also important to also consider helping those in need that you do not know as well. This can provide both a sense of satisfaction as well as aid in achieving the greater common good. It is often necessary to balance both to ensure that all parties are provided with the necessary help and support.
47	There is no provision in either document you cite which states that taxation should be imposed without consent of the people. While it is true that the Founding Fathers were involved in colonial governments prior to the Revolution, these governments were largely under British rule and subject to their taxation systems. Our Founding Fathers were ultimately opposed to the concept of taxation without representation and sought to ensure that the new nation was able to raise revenue in a more fair and equitable way. This necessitated the adoption of a constitution which outlined specific powers to the federal government and provided a mechanism for taxation to occur within those parameters.  It is also important to remember that while the Constitution specifically outlines the taxation process, it also outlines the process for collecting it, which is typically done by the federal government. Despite the unconstitutionality of some taxation systems, the federal government is still able to enforce them as it has the necessary power granted to it by the Constitution.
48	Ethically, it is important to protect an individual's privacy regardless of the actor. While it can be understandable why the public may want to know certain information, the invasion of an individual's privacy can be invasive and should be done with caution. In terms of governmental and private citizens' invasion of privacy, the right balance should be found to protect the individual's privacy while also allowing access to information when needed.
49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely difficult to convince. This is primarily due to their faith in the government and a lack of willingness to believe that their government could be involved in such a tragedy. This could potentially be the case in the future, but until then it is important to remain vigilant and continue to investigate the events of 9/11.
50	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art". However, almost all installation art since then has been a repetition of Duchamp's Fountain with minor variations. This has led to a sense of apathy and boredom as these art pieces lack innovation.    It is unfortunate that installation art has become so formulaic, as this prevents viewers from being truly engaged with the art. It is important for art pieces to challenge and explore new ideas in order to remain interesting. This can help ensure that art remains relevant and inspiring.     The aim of installation art should be to create pieces that are meaningful and inspiring, rather than simply repeating a single idea with slight variations. This can help to ensure that art remains vibrant and engaging for both artists and viewers.
51	Yes, it is important to remove George W. Bush from office. He has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, which is a serious offense and a reason for impeachment. While he may not be the most recent or worst offender, he should be held accountable for his actions. This can only be achieved through impeachment, and it is essential that we take action to ensure justice is served.  Therefore, we should vote in favor of impeaching Bush, as it is necessary to find a more capable leader for the US government.
52	At Poland Spring, we know that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.  To ensure the highest standards, we employ a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system that involves carefully controlled and continuously monitored disinfection processes in hygienically designed lines. We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. Every year, we screen for over 200 possible contaminants-far more than state and federal regulations require. This extensive quality control process helps us guarantee consistent, high quality water that is safe and of the highest quality.
53	Do you want contact with your children? Then it is important that you assert your legal rights as a father and take action to ensure that you and your children are able to maintain a meaningful relationship. California law generally favors granting visitation rights to fathers, although this can vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case. It is important to have a lawyer who is familiar with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the latest court order was issued to ensure that your rights are protected. Ultimately, it is in the best interest of all parties involved to have the children maintain a connection with their father.
54	I believe that access to education and employment opportunities are important factors in reducing poverty. While there are some cases where individuals may choose not to take advantage of these opportunities, there are often underlying issues such as physical or mental health problems, an unfavorable starting point in life, or other barriers that prevent individuals from accessing the resources they need. It is important to consider these complexities as well as the individual’s agency when assessing the reasons why individuals become or remain poor.
55	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, but I do believe that climate change is happening and is a serious issue. I doubt the extent to which climate change has occurred in recent times, but I think it is important to note that it has and will continue to happen in the future. While I believe that climate change is a serious issue, I also believe that it is important to have skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking. This can help to ensure that policies are evidence-based and that both sides of the argument are taken into consideration. While this debate can be difficult to navigate, I believe that it is important that it occurs and that both sides are respected. I think it is important to take all of these aspects into consideration when examining the issue of climate change.
56	Based on the potential that humans may be artificial intelligence but have rights, it is possible that if we are able to create another sentient being that is more intelligent, it may be equal to us. This could be determined depending on how much more advanced the new being is compared to us. It could be possible that it achieves the same things at a faster rate, which would make it greater than us. However, this is only possible if our creator allows us the same level of creativity and ability. Thus, it is unlikely that we would be able to create something of equal level as us.
57	It is recommended to report any injuries to your supervisor and fill out any necessary paperwork in order to ensure you have a strong case. In some cases, an employer may argue that the injury occurred outside of work, which can be difficult to prove without evidence. It is therefore important to be prepared and document the injury as best as you can. An attorney may be able to provide more advice on the specifics of your case, so it may be beneficial to consider speaking to one.
58	YES!  It is important to consider the effectiveness of current drug laws and whether or not they are achieving their stated goals. While prohibiting certain substances may have been deemed appropriate at the time, it is important to periodically reevaluate the laws in place to ensure they are still meeting society’s needs. NORML provides a great resource for individuals looking to learn more about marijuana law reform.
59	I recently attended a lecture which discussed these statistics. While the US crime rate is indeed going down, our rate of incarceration has stayed relatively steady. This is largely due to the US's "war on crime" and "war on drugs", initiated in the late 70s and early 80s under the Reagan administration. This suggests that we are more likely to use incarceration as a solution. To gain a more accurate perspective, it is important to consider the crime rates of all nations.  The US rate is certainly concerning and even worse for African-Americans, who have a rate of around 6,000+ per 100,000.
60	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Yes, this would be one of the requirements. However, allowing people to vote while incarcerated depends on the crime committed and the individual's record. There are some criminals who may be able to show that they have been reformed and should be given the chance to be an upstanding citizen again. This could be true for some criminals, however, there are others who should still be denied the right to vote due to the severity of their crimes and their records.
61	I moved to Phoenix in 2010 after living in Austin for seven years and was excited to find out Rudy's had a location in the area. I was pleased to find that the restaurant was just as unique and enjoyable as I remembered it from my time in Austin. The food was just as delicious and the atmosphere was just as quirky and fun. I'm glad I had the chance to experience it one last time before leaving the area. While I may not be as familiar with Rudy's since moving to Phoenix, I'm glad I was able to enjoy one last meal there before I moved.
62	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight people feel so strongly against them? If you want marriage to just be between you and your partner, then same-sex couples should have the right to form a legal bond as well. God accepts everyone, and everyone should have the right to show their love and commitment in a meaningful way. Bottom line, it should be a right to choose how to express your love.  This is a personal decision that should be respected.
63	There is always going to be a debate around whether a woman should have the right to choose whether to continue with a pregnancy or not. Regardless of how the pregnancy was conceived, it is important to consider the emotional and physical wellbeing of the woman, as well as that of the baby. Each woman should be provided with the necessary support to make an informed decision that is right for her.
64	I recently went fishing with a friend, and we caught and released several fish. While it is true that we used bait fish to catch the larger fish, this can be beneficial as it allows the bait fish to reproduce, as well as keeping the ecosystem in balance. It was still an unpleasant experience for the fish, but it is a necessary part of fishing in order to catch and release without killing the fish.  It is a difficult balance to strike, but I believe it is the best approach as it allows for a sustainable fish population while allowing fishing to remain an enjoyable activity.
65	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. This is great for tourism, which is an important part of any economy, but it should not be the only driver. There is also plenty of potential for business, commerce and industry in these areas, which can bring stability and growth to the local economy.   I have also been in this region for my entire life and understand how the local economy has evolved. While it may not have the same levels of activity as other areas of Florida, the area still has its own unique advantages.   For example, the SWFL (Fort Myers, Naples, Cape Coral) area offers an excellent quality of life for both retirees and snowbirds, as well as ample job opportunities for those seeking both seasonal and year-round employment. These opportunities are not limited to tourism, and it is my hope that the area will continue to grow and thrive.
66	We’ve seen the same faces in Congress for many years, and while this has its advantages as some legislators have an understanding of the system and how it works, it can also be a hindrance. It can prevent legislation from passing due to disagreements between parties. This can be frustrating as not all legislation requires support from the other party, and new legislators could bring a fresh perspective and more effective solutions. This could lead to increased efficiency and thus result in bills being successfully passed. Thus, it is beneficial to introduce term limits, ensuring that legislators do not stay in office for extended periods of time. This could provide a much needed injection of new ideas and talent in Congress, resulting in greater productivity.
67	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments I can't always understand. People quoting movies and shows can be effective in conveying certain ideas, but it is important to be mindful of the source material and ensure that it is used in a respectful way. It is important to be able to express yourself without relying too heavily on popular culture references, as this can help to ensure that your opinion is seen as valid and meaningful. This can help to make your views more unique and meaningful. While this can be a useful tool, it should be used judiciously and in moderation.
68	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  This friendship is beneficial to both countries, as it allows each to access resources and markets that would otherwise be difficult to access.  Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  Therefore, the US is able to take a more aggressive approach with Cuba as they do not offer as many economic benefits.  This allows the US to better protect their interests.
69	Depending on the state, 18 is the legal majority age, at which time parents are generally expected to provide financial support for their child until they reach adulthood. In most cases, this means that the parent is obligated to provide financial support for their 18 year old, even if they are living away from home and attending high school. While this can be difficult for both the parent and the child, it is generally necessary in order to ensure that the child has the necessary resources to complete their education.
70	I understand the Democratic Party receives the most money from PACs, while unions tend to contribute a smaller amount when compared to corporations. However, I believe unions should be able to use PACs and Super PACs during election season in order to provide a meaningful check to the power of corporations. While I understand this can lead to greater influence for unions, I believe it is an important balance to the current system. When a politician seeks to limit unions' ability to assemble and air grievances, it can feel similar to some state-socialist countries that do the same to their worker organizations, thus underscoring the need for an even playing field during elections.
71	FOUNDERS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOUNDING OF A PLACE, regardless of when it is discovered. While Farquhar was influential in the establishment of Singapore, Raffles still had authority over the island, and thus has the most credit for its founding.  It is true that Farquhar had a major role in the development of Singapore, but without Raffles' guidance and authorization, the island may not have been established at all. Therefore, Raffles is ultimately credited with founding Singapore.
72	EXCUSE ME! While some people may be more adept than others at using online forums, it is unfair to generalize and suggest that people may have dropped out of school or are lazy and fat. Everyone is different and has different levels of dedication and capabilities. It is possible to be an accomplished student while still being active on online forums.    In conclusion, while people may have different capabilities and levels of activity, it is unwise to jump to conclusions about someone's educational history or level of fitness. Everyone is unique and should be respected as such.
73	I believe that professional soccer players should receive some sort of penalty when they over exaggerate injuries. It can be difficult to decipher between legitimate injuries and exaggerated ones, which can give a poor image to the sport overall. In football, basketball, and other sports, players are able to brush off the bump and go back into the game without receiving a yellow card, which is effective in punishing any foul while also allowing the player to remain in the game. This can provide a good balance between punishing offenses and allowing players to remain in the game.
74	I believe that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness, as long as it is done in a safe and responsible way. Laws should exist to ensure that psychedelic drugs are used safely, while also recognizing the potential benefits they can bring. Studies have indicated that psychedelics, such as psilocybin (shrooms) and LSD, while potentially beneficial, are not as harmful as other drugs such as alcohol and tobacco. They are not addictive either, making them an appropriate choice for those willing to use them.  While some drugs such as nBOMe’s should remain illegal, it is important to recognize that not all psychedelics are created equally and should be treated with caution.
75	If that was the entire story, then it was unfortunate that an arrest was made as it may have caused unnecessary distress and anxiety for all involved. It is important to consider all the facts of the case and not just a single incident. The outcome could have been negotiated in such a way that both the parent and the child received appropriate advice and support, as well as learning the importance of maintaining safety in different environments. In this way, everyone would have benefited from the experience.
76	How do I think we obtained our freedom by standing back? Through hard work, bravery, and sacrifice, our military was able to provide us with the freedom that we have today. In the public eye, Iraq does not deserve freedom in the same way that we have it, however, this does not mean that we should abandon them as a country. We must remain engaged in order to ensure that stability and freedom are maintained in the region. Without continued effort from all countries involved, peace may be difficult to achieve in these areas. This requires a collective effort from all countries to ensure stability and peace in other countries.
77	Definitely, the universal soldier/bomb maker would reduce the occurrence of war as it would limit the amount of destruction caused by weapons. Without the access to advanced weaponry, there would be less control over the masses - which is a good thing. There would simply be calm and less-cral areas of the world, with fewer casualties and less property damage. This can only be beneficial in the long run.
78	Gay marriage is a valid lifestyle choice and should be accepted by society, as it is a way for individuals to express their love and commitment to one another. Although it may make some people uncomfortable, it is a right that should be respected as it allows couples to have the same rights and protections as other married couples. Everyone should be afforded the same respect and understanding, regardless of their sexual orientation.
79	Having a bad father can be difficult, as it can lead to a lasting impact on the child. However, having no father at all can be just as difficult as it can lead to a child feeling a sense of abandonment and loss. Therefore, while it may be better to have a lousy father for practical reasons, it can still be very traumatic for the child and have lasting effects.
80	CarCraze - while the court does have the power to issue a motion to collect a debt, it is important to understand the implications of this. A motion to collect a debt can be intimidating and it is important to take the appropriate steps to ensure that you are aware of the options available to you. In this case, it is wise to seek legal counsel to explore your options and ensure that you make a decision that is suitable for your situation. It is important to understand the terms of the court order, how it may affect you, and what steps you can take to take the best course of action.  It is important to understand the implications of such a court order, and to ensure that you understand all of your available options.
81	I believe that legalizing performance enhancing drugs in professional sports could be detrimental to both the athletes and younger generations. While these drugs may give athletes an edge, the potential risks and long-term effects can be significant and potentially irreversible. As such, it is in the best interest of the government, leagues, and athletes to ensure performance enhancing drugs remain illegal. This will protect athlete health and discourage young athletes from using these drugs.
82	Well, the problem is -- until there is conclusive evidence that a judge has broken the law or violated a judicial ethical rule, they cannot be removed from office, absent a supermajority vote of the House.   Improper conduct for a judge may be nothing more than a violation of a judicial ethical rule, and could be something as simple as allowing the appearance of impropriety. It can happen where the judge has never broken the law or even never actually done anything unethical -- just the appearance is enough to remove the judge sometimes. But just that appearance is not grounds for forcibly removing an elected official from office. They need to actually have done done something illegal, generally at felony level.   As for the guy who had cash in his freezer, this is very suspicious and could lead to disciplinary action, but it is not necessarily illegal. It would depend on the circumstances and the context of the situation.
83	Here's another thing to consider...while some judges can be bought, they are not the only issue. The judicial system is based on the idea of impartiality, so that each case can be evaluated fairly and independently of outside influences. However, in some cases, certain judges - especially certain Supreme Court Justices - have been seen to go beyond the scope of their judicial authority and allow their personal political beliefs to influence their decisions. This can be worrying and it highlights the importance of judicial selection processes. It is important to ensure that judges are selected on their ability to uphold fair and impartial judgments, rather than their political views.   This is a complex issue, and while the occasional unethical judge does exist, it is important to make sure that this does not become a common occurrence. It is essential that judges are chosen carefully and with the utmost care.
84	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike, Bobby Sands and other IRA members were denied the title of political prisoners, resulting in their deaths. This was a difficult and controversial decision, as it caused a great deal of anguish across the UK.   Whilst this was undoubtedly a difficult period for the UK, it is important to remember that many parts of Britain experienced a great deal of decline in their industries during this time, which was further exacerbated by a number of external factors. Despite this, the UK was still able to make a successful recovery.  It is clear that Thatcher's decisions were not universally popular, however it is also important to recognize the positive changes that she was able to implement in order to help bring about a UK recovery.   I can understand why her policies have been met with both praise and criticism, but it is clear that her decisions had a significant long-term positive impact on the UK economy.
85	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping carries some risks, such as babies rolling or falling out of beds or disrupting the parent's intimacy. It is important to be mindful of these risks and make sure to create a safe sleep environment for the infant. While it may be difficult to establish a routine initially, it is recommended to try and slowly transition the infant to their own bed. This can be easier said than done and may require some trial and error. However, basinet bassinets are a useful tool to help make the transition smoother. They are smaller and more lightweight than traditional cribs and can be easily moved to fit the sleeping arrangements. Therefore, while cosleeping should be discouraged, it can be done with some preparation and care.
86	Typically, the question that parents may ask is how the child support amount can be adjusted in the event that one or both parents experience a change in income. In some cases, this can be done through the court system.  In some states, the court system can assess cost of living increases annually to ensure that the support amount remains fair.  This can help provide both parents with greater financial stability.  It may also be possible to request a review of the child support amount if there has been a significant change in either parent’s income or circumstances.  This can help ensure that the support amount remains fair and reasonable for both parents.
87	It is difficult to say for certain whether India has the potential to lead the world, as there are many other nations that may be more progressive, literate, and powerful in the future. While India may not have the same levels of technology as some of the countries in the Americas, it does have the potential to make great strides in the future. While it is impossible to know for sure, India certainly has the potential to lead the world given time and resources.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Minimum wage jobs often require more than just the minimum wage rate in order to be competitive in the job market, as employers need to take into account the skills and effort of the employee in order to remain competitive. Therefore, employers may choose to offer higher wages to attract better employees and ensure productivity. Although minimum wage jobs may not always offer the opportunity for promotion or increased wages, employers may still require more of an effort from their employees beyond just the minimum requirements.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider or attempt suicide, they also have the strength to live on. It is a difficult decision to make and one that should not be taken lightly as it can have lasting consequences. It is important to remember that there are professionals available to talk to and get the support needed in order to make an informed decision. Ultimately, it is important to understand that suicide is a choice that should not be taken lightly and that help is available.
90	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county’s sheriff’s office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, as well as submitting an application for the handgun purchase. In some states, including North Carolina, gun control laws are stringent and can require a great deal of effort to comply with. This can be very frustrating for those who wish to own a gun, as it can seem like a difficult and complex process.   It is difficult to determine exactly how different states should regulate gun ownership, as it is largely up to the individual states to decide how they would like to legislate this. There is not yet a national standard on gun control laws and it is important that each state is given the autonomy to decide the best way to ensure public safety while still allowing law-abiding citizens to own guns. It is difficult to determine the best way to regulate this in every state, so it may be beneficial to allow the states to decide on their own regulations.
91	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike".     These gender roles can put unnecessary pressure on men and may make them feel like they are unable to express their emotions or take on more traditionally feminine roles. It can also be damaging for relationships if both partners are not given equal opportunities to express their genders in their own way. It is important to have gender-neutral phrasing in order to allow for more equality between the genders.     Gender neutral phrasing allows for both men and women to express their roles in a way that is comfortable and natural to them. This can lead to more understanding and harmony between the genders, rather than creating unnecessary pressure and dividing roles along gender lines.
92	This may vary from country to country, but in my experience, healthy food can be just as affordable as unhealthy options depending on the local market and the quantity being purchased. For example, in the UK, it is possible to purchase carrots, celery and oats for relatively low prices when bought in bulk, as well as chicken breast for a good price when bought in large quantities. This shows that healthy food can be just as affordable as unhealthy options and can be a more cost-effective choice in the long run.   In conclusion, while it may be more expensive to purchase unhealthy options in some cases, it is possible to find healthy alternatives which are cost-effective when bought in larger quantities.
93	Yahoo! Answers can be biased in both political and racial aspects, as it is impossible to predict the exact way in which a question will be answered. This can be seen from the fact that certain questions may receive differing levels of scrutiny depending on the political or racial views of the administration. It is therefore important to consider the political landscape when asking questions on the site, as the answers can vary drastically depending on the context.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism can be managed and accommodated in order for individuals to reach their full potential. While it can make focus difficult, when individuals are able to focus they can achieve great successes. This can be seen in the accomplishments of those with ADHD who force themselves to concentrate, such as obtaining high grades and retaining knowledge. Autism can also present unique skills that allow individuals to excel, such as in math, science and music. It is important that we allow these individuals to grow and reach their full potential, as this can contribute to the evolution of our species in the future.
95	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. The result is an inconsistent view which can be influenced by many different factors. It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself as there are so many variables to consider. Thus, it is important to weigh up both sides of the argument and consider all of the available evidence in order to make an informed decision.
96	Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured , then killed by other cars passing over it.  While it is understandable that watching this occurrence can be distressing, it is important to acknowledge that all lives, regardless of their species, should be respected.  It is understandable that one might not feel any strong emotional reactions to such an event, however it is still important to show compassion and empathy for the animal, as they are alive and their life should be respected regardless of ownership. While it may not have a direct impact on our lives, it is still an emotional experience that can be difficult to process and understand.
97	Three debates in one day criticizing my views on upholding convinceme's seriousness?  Convinme is the only administrator for this website, and as such it is important that the guidelines for debate topics are followed. While it is understandable that rules may be seen as limiting some of the creativity of debates, they are necessary to ensure that topics remain constructive and respectful for all members. It is important for all parties to feel that their voice is heard and this is best achieved when guidelines are adhered to.  Thus, it is important to ensure that debate topics are clearly defined so as to maintain the integrity of the website. It is ultimately the responsibility of all members to ensure that debates remain constructive, and the community should feel empowered to do so. In order to maintain the integrity of the debates, it is important to make sure that guidelines are respected.
98	The Americans have been gunning for his death for some time, and will likely advocate for the death penalty. However, such decisions should be left to the tribunal and should not be rushed. It is important to remember that Saddam is respected by many Iraqis and that this could cause unrest if the tribunal rules too quickly. Additionally, the recent events in Iraq involving the Shias and Sunnis demonstrate the complexities of the situation, which must be taken into consideration when deciding the fate of Saddam. Ultimately, the outcome should be determined by the tribunal as it takes into account all the factors involved.
99	The Cold War is over, and trade and travel between Cuba and the US are now possible. After over 48 years of the same policy in place, it is clear that it has not had the desired effect of opening Cuban society or increasing US business involvement. Both countries would benefit from a new approach which allows normal relations, trade and travel between the two countries.  It is clear that the current policy has not achieved its goals and it is time to move on and build a new relationship between the two nations.
