0	Climate change clearly does not exist, as evidenced by the fact that exhaling carbon dioxide is not a clear threat to our climate, and also by the fact that it is a widely-discussed conspiracy theory. Sources indicate that there are no reliable sources to back up the claim that climate change exists.
1	Humans are the primary cause of recent global warming, with a consensus of 97-100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies. This is supported by the additional evidence of 14,947 French deaths, increased mortality from heat events, 150,000 annual deaths caused by anthropogenic climate change, and cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious disease outbreaks related to climate fluctuations.
2	Climate change is an established scientific fact and human activity is the primary cause of it. Over 97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused emissions are the primary driver of climate change, and deniers' arguments are not supported by scientific
3	Climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Denying its existence could result in the spread of dangerous diseases, the displacement of people, and the increased risk of wars and conflicts.
4	The climate is warming due to human activities, and this warming is happening at an unprecedented rate. Claims that climate change is a fraud imply that the majority of scientists are wrong and are intentionally lying, which is a big claim that incurs its own burden of proof.
5	The climate is not changing. The local weather may change but the global climate stays basically the same.
6	Climate change is a threat to the planet and should not be taken lightly, but it is important to consider both sides of the argument. According to the science, increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide have caused a slight rise in temperatures, but this could just be a natural fluctuation in the earth's temperature that happens from time to time.
7	Climate change is a complex and multifaceted issue, and there is disagreement amongst experts on the best solutions to address it. Some of the points brought up in the argument, such as the 97% consensus fraud, are incorrect and have been debunked by the scientific community.
8	The argument presented here contends that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent. From a common definition, anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature.
9	Climate change is an ongoing political debate that deniers attempt to make look like a scientific one, yet 97% of scientists agree on its existence. Additionally, the burning of fossil fuels and the resulting CO2 em
10	Feminism aims to promote gender equality and empower women, however there are many different types of feminism with Antiporn and Cultural Feminism advocating for the reality that women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative, while pornography dehumanizes women. Therefore, feminism has not gone too far, but is simply pushing for equality and emp
11	Feminism is a movement advocating for the equality of women, irrespective of gender. Although commonly associated with females, men can also be feminists and advocate for gender equality.
12	Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women, and Con has not provided any evidence to suggest that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings, thus their argument is not sound. Furthermore, Con has not provided any sources to define masculinism, rendering their argument invalid.
13	Feminism is the advocacy of equal rights, social, political, and economic, for women as for men. It is not the promotion of false rape accusations or stereotyping men as bad, and any attempts to do so are not reflective of the movement.
14	Feminism is an important movement that works to reduce gender inequality in all countries, including first world countries. Although gender equality has been achieved in some parts of the world, it is still necessary to promote and fight for women’s rights in other parts of the world.
15	In order for feminism to be successfully implemented in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, the conditions of the countries' economies and social interactions must first be taken into consideration. As such, slow and progressive changes must be made to tackle each situation differently, instead of introducing feminism suddenly and abruptly.
16	Feminism today has evolved from its original definition of believing men and women should be equal. Third wave feminism, which is modern feminism, focuses on empowering women and is sometimes seen as militant or extreme.
17	Feminism is about fighting for gender equality, which includes recognizing and addressing the unique issues faced by women. Men and other groups are not excluded from feminist movements and ideologies, however, feminism itself does not focus on addressing issues faced by other groups.
18	Feminism, by its very definition, advocates for women's rights and political, social, and economic equality with men. Con thus admits that pro is pro-feminism, as per the definition of feminism.
19	Feminism today is a hypocritical and twisted movement, abandoning it and instead striving for equal rights for both men and women is the best way to go.
20	Abortion should not be legal, as it is not a safe procedure, laws are meant to protect unborn babies, and fetuses can feel pain. Mother Teresa's quote highlights the moral implications of abortion, which is why it should not be legal.
21	My opponent has argued that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds. I will address each of these points in turn.   
22	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion.
23	Abortion is a highly controversial issue, with many people taking opposing views on the matter. Some believe it is wrong and should be illegal, while others believe it should be legal and accessible.
24	Abortion is a highly controversial issue. Some people believe that it should be allowed in certain cases, while others believe that it is wrong in all cases.
25	Abortion is needed to control the population and prevent it from growing too excessive. If our country stops the use of abortion, we will end up like China, forcing women to have abortions against their will and risking higher suicide rates among women.
26	Abortion can be a difficult decision for a woman to make, but it is her choice whether or not to go through with it. Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate, as abortion is a personal decision that should not be governed
27	Proposing a ban on abortion would force women to either give birth to a child they don't want or to pay for an abortion in order to avoid the financial burden of raising a child. This could lead to more women being forced into prostitution and slavery in order to pay for their abortion, creating a greater social and economic burden
28	Abortion should be legal as it is a woman's right to choose what is best for her body and life. Furthermore, research shows that making abortion illegal does not reduce the number of abortions, but increases maternal mortality.
29	The morality of abortion should be determined by whether or not a fetus is sentient, rather than based on whether it is a person or not. This is a unique debate, as most abortion discussions have not considered the perspective of a non-pregnant person.
30	The statement "trump is life" is false, as trump or trump cards do not meet the requirements for life. These requirements include the ability to grow, change, and adapt, as well as metabolism, reproduction, and the ability to respond to environmental stimuli.
31	Trump's racist rhetoric is damaging to the US, creating mistrust and inciting hatred which leads to crime and the destruction of communities. His words have no place in society and should never be supported.
32	Trump's policies of building a wall, fighting ISIS, and strengthening the Christian religion will make him the greatest president of all time, according to his supporters.
33	Trump is an inconsiderate jerk who thinks he can say whatever he likes without consequence, and he has no plan to reduce our debt despite wanting to build a wall.
34	Trump's policies of racism and xenophobia will lead to the emergence of organizations like the Minutemen, who will hunt down and kill immigrants, as well as innocent Americans. This is an unacceptable risk to our society, and we must vote down Trump to prevent this harm from occurring.
35	Donald Trump has changed his opinion on certain issues and has donated to and supported the Clintons in the past, yet he is not extremely religious and does not ask for forgiveness. He was proven to be open to various healthcare reforms in the past and currently supports a 100% free market system.
36	Donald Trump is the best candidate for defeating ISIS as he is not afraid to speak out against them and is a skilled negotiator and dealmaker. Furthermore, Trump is not politically correct and will voice his opinions directly, which can be beneficial in foreign relations.
37	It is clear that Trump has the potential to be a valuable card in any suit, as he would be able to win over any card that is not of the same suit. Therefore, if elected President of the World, he could prove successful in leading such an organization.
38	President Trump has not been found to have lied in any way that is substantially different from other US politicians and media outlets, so there is no need to track his lies specially.
39	Donald Trump is a serial liar who has trouble telling the truth, according to Politifact, which has rated 76% of his statements as "mostly false," "false," or "pants on fire." In contrast, Hillary Clinton's total is 29%.
40	Brexit will result in both positive and negative effects, but the negative effects of Brexit will likely outweigh the positive. The UK leaving the EU could lead to economic turmoil, trade issues, and a weaker voice in international affairs.
41	The leave side of Brexit had the rhetoric of taking back control of Britain's borders and economy, while the remain side had the facts of the cost of EU membership and the economic cost of leaving. Leaving the EU would have a minimal effect on immigration policy and would likely hurt the UK economy in the long run.
42	Brexit will be beneficial for England as it allows them to secure their border from the influx of migrants, prevent illegal immigration from the Middle East and save money from the fees of being in the EU. Switzerland and Norway are example of countries that have gained economically and do not have to follow the rules imposed by the EU.
43	Brexit has become a contentious issue as it would affect the UK’s relationship with the EU. The UK believes that leaving the EU would give them more control over their own affairs and resources, while the EU is concerned that a breakaway would result in economic and political instability.
44	Britain has a long history of strong ties with Europe, which has contributed to its prosperity. While the economies of Greece, France, and Spain are struggling, Britain's economy has continued to grow and has been resilient in the face of Brexit.
45	Leaving the EU could have a negative impact on Indian businesses, as well as increased risk for English businesses due to the volatility of the pound.
46	The people of England are facing difficulties due to the influx of migrants seeking jobs, leading to a rise in unemployment and a diminishment of quality of life. This could be remedied by Brexit, which might face some initial challenges establishing, but would provide employment opportunities for the people of England, as well as new trading possibilities with other countries.
47	Leaving the EU does not mean that Britain will abandon its joint efforts in the fight against terrorism. We can still share information with other countries, while having the ability to make our own decisions regarding the entry of migrants from Islamic countries.
48	The UK's decision to leave the European Union will bring them increased self-sufficiency and a newfound sense of freedom. Despite what the media claims, independence has always brought prosperity in the past, and this will be no exception.
49	The death penalty is an expensive form of punishment that does not deter crime, has caused the execution of innocent people, and does not help prevent crime. It should, therefore, be abolished in favor of alternative forms of punishment that have been proven to be more effective.
50	The death penalty is more expensive than life in prison without parole in both the short and long term. Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), wrote in an Oct. 1, 1997 JFA presentation that "Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years.
51	The death penalty is an effective and cost-efficient form of punishment that deters crime, reduces recidivism, and is supported by the majority of the American public. Removing the death penalty will have negative effects, such as an increase in crime and a decrease in the certainty of punishment.
52	The death penalty has a purpose - to deter crime, avenge innocent lives, and decrease overcrowding in prisons. It is effective at doing so and should be implemented in order to protect citizens from violent criminals.
53	The death penalty is a good idea as it decreases the prisoner population, ensures that criminals cannot kill again and is a deterrent.
54	The death penalty is an inefficient, costly and unfair form of punishment that does not deter crime, and is ultimately replaced by life imprisonment which is less expensive and much more humane. Innocent people are too often executed, and the death penalty is applied in an unfair manner that disproportionately affects minorities and the economically disadvantaged.
55	The death penalty is flawed, as it implies that a jury of twelve people can take away an individual's life. In addition, when someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, an innocent person is executed, which is intolerable.
56	The death penalty is more expensive than imprisonment for life, both at the trial and appellate level. Additionally, innocent people have been executed in the past, which is a risk with the death penalty.
57	The death penalty provides a meaningful punishment for heinous crimes while creating justice that is both swift and certain. It deters potential criminals from committing heinous acts and provides closure for victims’ families.
58	The death penalty is not an effective deterrent and can lead to wrongful executions, while life imprisonment focuses more on rehabilitation and forgiveness, which is more humane. Furthermore, life imprisonment is generally cheaper than the death penalty and does not pose any risk of executing innocent people.
59	Google is increasing its presence in our lives by releasing products such as Google Classroom and cars. If everyone uses these products, it will lead to a world where all documents are available online and paper may become extinct.
60	Google has been around longer than Bing, so it is understandable why it has more visitors. However, the tests have shown that 33% of Google users would be using Bing more often, which indicates that Bing might be better than Google.
61	Google is a reliable source, and Con's argument that it is not is illogical. Con provides no evidence to back up their argument and is wrong to assume that all arguments must be supported by reputable sources.
62	Google has numerous safety flaws which make it an unreliable search engine. Additionally, my opponent has failed to refute any of my arguments, suggesting he concedes the debate.
63	Google is often preferred to Bing even though most of its users are biased towards it due to their preferences. This is because those who dislike Bing often use Google and seldom use Bing, which prevents them from being able to fairly compare the two.
64	Google does not block results for “authorities on subjects” when one searches for them, as typing in “New Scientist” alongside the query will bring up relevant results. The issue is not that Google is an ultimate truth-selling authority, but rather that it challenges existing authorities, such as The Economist, on economics.
65	Google is the clear winner in the battle between newspapers and search engines, as established authorities have the resources to purchase top slots and protect their content, while gullible children can rely on their parents to verify the accuracy of search results.
66	Google glass can be a powerful tool for helping students learn, but educators must adapt to the changing technology and find new ways to ensure students are learning effectively. There is a balance to be struck between utilizing technology to its full potential and making sure students are
67	The Google Review System is bad because it is not possible to guarantee safety, Even with laws and regulations to function. Therefore, Reviews cannot be 100% safe, Which is the criteria for success.
68	Google+ integration with YouTube has been beneficial for users, as it has increased viewer engagement, viewership, and subscriptions to channels. It has also reduced spam comments and links, as Google+ users must verify their identity through a phone or email verification system.
69	To go vegan and stop the murder of these animals would not only counter the effects of our evolution, but also destroy the industries involved in the selling of these foods, which might mess up the economy. Plus, steak and bacon are amazing.
70	Veganism is an ethical lifestyle choice which rejects the commodification of animals, as well as the exploitation of individuals by other individuals. Vegans abstain from products made from animal sources and reject the sale of commodities such as meat and leather.
71	The resolution states that at least 99% of human adults should eat vegan in the entire world. This means that veganism should be embraced willingly, not forced upon anyone.
72	Humans are omnivores and have been eating both plants and animals for millennia. Forcing everyone to go vegan would be unnatural and could lead to a domino effect that could harm many different aspects of our environment, from animal populations to the dairy and meat industry.
73	Hippopotamuses are vegan, meaning they do not consume any animal products, including eggs and dairy. However, some other animal species, such as whales, porpoises, and pigs, are not vegan, as they do consume animal products.
74	Meat eaters are not ignorant in my opinion. I am sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro-animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one.
75	Humans have exploited animals for food and resources for centuries, and the vegan debate centers around the ethical implications of that practice. While it is understandable to take a broader view of the topic and acknowledge the human dependency on animals, the original point was about the welfare of animals, which is what veganism specifically aims to address.
76	Women today are increasingly open to consuming their partners' semen as a sign of their love and trust. Some, however, are vegan for ethical reasons and refuse to consume animal products, including sperm.
77	Vegans are inconsistent in their adherence to socialism as they choose to consume animal products on occasion, thereby acting in a hypocritical manner.
78	Most animals are vegans and vegetables have all the vitamins and minerals that you've mentioned, so B12 supplements may be necessary for some humans. Vegetables and fruits are also rich in nutrients that can't be found in meat,
79	Nuclear energy has many benefits economically, environmentally and socially, but carries risks that need to be carefully considered. Nuclear power plants are expensive to build, but they can generate highly efficient energy and will save us money in the long run.
80	Nuclear energy presents many advantages but also carries risks associated with radioactive waste. Renewable energies such as wind, hydro, and solar, are more affordable and efficient than nuclear, and are becoming increasingly popular in contrast to nuclear.
81	Nuclear energy creates jobs that are necessary for a healthy economy, and the cost of generating power from nuclear sources is low. Solar energy plants are a viable alternative, but my opponent has neglected to consider the benefits of nuclear power in this debate.
82	Nuclear energy has many benefits, but also some drawbacks. It is more efficient than other forms of energy production, and produces less pollution and radioactive waste.
83	Nuclear energy has several drawbacks, such as radioactive waste, cost, dependency, and accidents. The United Kingdom produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste annually, which is a problem.
84	Nuclear energy provides a viable and efficient option for the generation of sustainable electricity. It has been proven to be significantly more efficient and safe than other forms of energy production, with nuclear power plants causing next to no deaths when compared to other forms of energy production.
85	Nuclear energy has its drawbacks like any other source of energy, but it is efficient and cost-effective. Other countries have already proven that they can handle the waste and disaster risks associated with it, and the USA is not likely to use its weapons anyway.
86	Nuclear energy is an unreliable and dangerous form of energy production that has not been proven to be an effective or efficient way to meet our energy demands.
87	Nuclear energy currently accounts for around 20% of the world's energy supply, but it is unable to meet increasing demand as it can only create 20% due to limited efficiency. Further issues arise with the production of nuclear waste and the cooling systems associated with it, making it an unviable solution for the future of energy.
88	Sorry, I've been cruising around in the Caribbean for the past week. I thought I'd have internet, but I didn't.
89	Donald Trump is a businessman and conservatives and independents are hoping he will promote the things they believe in, but his past donations to Democratic Party organizations and organizations conservatives were against raise questions about who he really is.
90	Donald Trump has had some success in business, but he is not infallible. If he were to lose his touch, his unstable qualities could lead to disaster.
91	Donald Trump is a highly controversial candidate for the US presidency. He has no political experience, is known to be racist and sexist, and has failed to provide concrete details on how he plans to achieve his ambitious proposals.
92	Donald Trump has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and doesn't explain things at all. He said he will replace Obamacare with "something terrific", but without explaining how it will be.
93	Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power by wielding the dark side of the Force, typically using crimson lightsabers and taking down weaker candidates in order to seize the highest position of power in the government. He is hated by the Sith for his connection with the light side of the Force and his peaceful and pacifist nature, as well as his criticism of Mexico and its immigrants.
94	Donald Trump is a racist and a liar who believes that white supremacists are heroes and may try to kill the current president of the United States. Support Drago 31 to stand against him.
95	Donald Jackleberry Trump is not my president because he is an imaginary character. Although qwzx has accepted this debate with knowledge that this results in automatic loss, as dictated by rule 6, qwzx is attempting to argue that I was not specific enough on what exactly you will lose.
96	Donald Trump may be a successful businessman, but he is not fit to be President of the United States due to his lack of humanity and inability to connect with people. He has already caused protests, including the organization of the Women's March, which demonstrates his incompetence in leading the largest economy in the world.
97	The statement that "the American Dream is dead" is not true; however, if Donald Trump wins the election, it could be in danger. Hillary Clinton accused Trump of being a racist and he responded that she was desperately attempting to hold on to her lead in the Democratic primary against Bernie Sanders.
98	Donald Trump is the only President who is telling the truth and is trying to make a difference, yet nobody is listening to him. The Democrats have only been finding fault and not helping people, which has led to a greater mess.
