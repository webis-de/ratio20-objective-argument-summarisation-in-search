0	The argument that climate change does not exist is unsupported. Breathing out carbon dioxide is not a threat to our climate since it is a natural part of the carbon cycle, however our emissions of carbon dioxide are increasing at an alarming rate and leading to an excess of the gas in our atmosphere, which is a contributing factor to global warming and climate change.
1	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is real and has already caused loss of life. According to estimates by the World Health Organization, man-made climate change has resulted in more than 150,000 deaths annually due to its effects on extreme heat events.
2	The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that climate change is primarily caused by human activity, and those who dispute this fact are incorrect. Global warming is an established reality, not a matter of opinion.
3	Climate change poses a grave danger to the planet and humanity, and the spread of potentially fatal illnesses like the Zika virus is among the risks we face due to it. Moreover, there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is caused by human activity.
4	Climate change is real and human-caused, with the overwhelming consensus of scientists in agreement. Dismissing this established fact is deceptive, as it requires not just disbelieving the vast majority of experts, but also that they are knowingly lying.
5	The climate is not changing at a drastic or rapid rate. Local weather conditions may vary, but the global climate remains largely consistent.
6	Climate change is an ongoing phenomenon primarily caused by human industrial activity that has been associated with a noticeable increase in temperature. This has been backed up by scientific findings such as increased atmospheric CO2 levels and a 1Â°C rise in global temperatures since 1969.
7	Climate change is a serious issue that deserves to be addressed, however, the argument that it is solely caused by human activity is based on weak evidence and flawed science. Those who believe in human-caused climate change are not all frauds and charlatans, but the debate over its cause should not be discounted.
8	The effects of climate change are a hot topic these days, with many people debating whether human activities are the main cause or if natural forces are primarily responsible. While some claim that human actions are contributing to global climate change, others maintain that natural cycles are the primary driver of climate change.
9	Climate change is an ongoing political debate, but there is a 97% consensus among experts that humans are the primary cause of recent global climate events. Carbon dioxide emissions are a key factor in global warming and have caused global temperatures to rise significantly.
10	Feminism is a movement that works to achieve equality for women. Different forms of feminism, such as Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism, have different approaches and goals. All feminisms share the goal of recognizing the value and rights of women and working to secure them.
11	Gender equality is the advocacy of equal rights and opportunities for all individuals, regardless of gender identity. It is not associated with negative attributes, nor should it be limited to any specific gender.
12	Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women, and Con has failed to provide any proof that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has not provided any evidence for this claim.
13	Feminism is the advocacy for social, political, and economic equality for all genders. Feminists strive to create a world where all people are equal and are treated with respect and dignity.
14	Feminism is an important movement that seeks to bring about equality between the sexes and is still needed in many parts of the world. Although success has been found in some first-world countries, inequality still exists and feminism will still be important to maintain that equality and help spread the ideology to other parts of the world where help is needed.
15	Feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but the conditions of the countries' economy and social interaction should be taken into account. Slow, gradual changes should be made to address each issue individually before feminism is introduced.
16	Feminism originally arose to campaign for gender equality and justice for men and women alike. However, modern feminism has become an ideology fixated on vengeance towards the historical injustices committed against women. Although blaming men for the acts of prior generations is counterproductive and will only add to the divide between the sexes, achieving true equality remains a necessity.
17	Feminism is a movement which advocates for the rights and equality of women. Egalitarianism is the belief that all people should be treated equally, regardless of gender.
18	Feminism is defined as "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men". Conceded that feminism is good, as well as not denying that feminism is bad by not attacking my advantages of feminism.
19	Today's feminism is distorted and hypocritical, thus making it best to abandon it and strive for equalism for both men and women.
20	Abortion should be illegal as it can put women's safety at risk, unborn babies should be protected by laws and there is evidence to suggest that fetuses can feel pain.
21	The debate around abortion has been ongoing for centuries and there are two opposed perspectives. Those in favor of abortion think that women should have the right to decide whether they want to continue with the pregnancy, while those against it consider abortion to be illegal since it implies the termination of a potential life.
22	Abortion can occur intentionally or unintentionally, and can be induced by humans or happen spontaneously. Induced abortions can be therapeutic or elective, while spontaneous abortions are usually referred to as miscarriages.
23	The debate around abortion is an ongoing one, with both sides presenting valid arguments. Some contend that it should be legal, as it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body, while others contend that it should be illegal as it is the taking of an innocent life.  Both sides bring up compelling points, making this a complex and thought-provoking issue.
24	Abortion is a contentious issue, with many individuals having strong opinions either for or against it. Supporters of abortion typically contend that it is a woman's right to choose and should remain legal, while those opposed believe that it is the killing of an unborn child and should be illegal.
25	Allowing abortion is necessary to regulate population growth and prevent it from getting out of hand. If we don't enable abortion, population growth could be hastened through coercion and women might be forced to consider abortion later in life, potentially resulting in an increase in the suicide rate.
26	The statement "Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate" implies that whether abortion is considered morally wrong or not is not relevant to the debate. However, this is not true, as the topic of abortion being immoral or wrong is an important part of the debate. Therefore, whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is highly relevant to the topic.
27	Allowing abortion is beneficial because the costs of unintended pregnancies and childbearing can be extremely high, while forcing mothers to carry children they do not want can lead to unfavorable outcomes for both parties. Furthermore, raising a child until the age of 18 typically costs around 250K.
28	Women's lives, health, and basic human rights are inextricably linked to the availability of abortion, and making it illegal will have dire consequences with devastating effects on maternal mortality.
29	Abortion is a highly contentious issue, with various points of view and opinions. Those in favour of legalising it contend that it is a woman's right to choose.
30	It is impossible for Trump to be considered as life, since he fails to meet any of the requirements for life, such as maintaining balanced conditions, being highly organized, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, or reproduction.
31	Trump's racist rhetoric is damaging and destructive, and will cause harm to the US by breeding mistrust, hostility and crime.
32	Trump's plan to build a wall, combat ISIS, and strengthen Christian faith will make him the most successful president ever, according to his supporters. He asserts that his plan will bring back jobs from China, Japan, Mexico and other countries, as well as bring back American money.
33	Trump's disregard for the repercussions of his words and actions is remarkable, and his policies won't fix our debt or excuse us from following international laws in regards to building a wall and ignoring Mexico's input on the matter.
34	Voting for Trump, whose stance on immigration could lead to the emergence of racist organizations that perpetuate violence and kill innocent people, is not advisable.
35	Donald Trump has changed his opinions on policy and made contributions to both Bill and Hillary Clinton in the past, but this does not necessarily indicate that he is secretly plotting to get them elected. Furthermore, he has not violated any scriptural teachings by claiming not to need to ask for forgiveness from God.
36	Donald Trump argues that his tough negotiating skills and lack of political correctness make him best positioned to fight ISIS. He also contends that ISIS has grown wealthy from terrorism and is now a direct competitor of his hotels.
37	Trump lacks the necessary qualifications and popular support to serve as president of the world, as his election would require the overturning of a card selected by the people. A president must be appointed or elected by the people to preside over an organized body of people, and Trump's position cannot be chosen by a single card.
38	Trump's lack of complete honesty is consistent with the typical standards of US politicians and media outlets nowadays.
39	Donald Trump has repeatedly been caught in lies, with many of his statements being rated as "mostly false," "false," or "pants on fire" byPolitifact. His dishonesty is a clear indicator of his unfitness to serve as President of the United States.
40	Leaving the European Union will provide the UK with the opportunity to have full control over its own laws and regulations, allowing the nation to shape policy in a way that is best for its own interests. Additionally, Brexit could bring about an improved economic climate through new trade opportunities and increased growth.
41	Leaving the EU would not have been economically beneficial for the UK, and would likely have caused a long-term negative impact on the economy. Additionally, Britain would have had no control over its immigration policy if it had left the EU, and would have likely seen negative effects from limiting immigration.
42	The United Kingdom will benefit from Brexit as it will enable them to set their own borders, regulate immigration from the Middle East, save them money from not having to pay EU fees, and grant them the autonomy to make their own laws and regulations without interference from the European Union.
43	Brexit is an issue of national security and economic freedom. The migrant crisis in Europe is evidence that having open borders is a recipe for disaster, allowing terrorists, criminals, and refugees to easily cross borders unchecked. This makes it more difficult to protect our citizens, while also threatening our economic stability. Therefore, it is in our best interest to take back control of our borders and to regain the freedoms that come with it.
44	Britain has greatly benefitted from its centuries-long connections with Europe, and its economy has flourished as a result of its continued integration with the continent and its free trade policies.
45	The UK's exit from the EU could create economic uncertainty for Indian businesses, potentially leading to decreased investment and movement of professionals to the UK, as well as an increased risk associated with the volatility of the UK pound.
46	The UK must leave the EU in order to give its people more opportunities for work, education, and healthcare. This is due to the fact that being in the EU is negatively impacting England's migration and employment levels, resulting in a decreased quality of life for its citizens.
47	Leaving the EU will give Britain the freedom to determine its own immigration policy and laws, allowing it to determine which migrants to admit and under what conditions, as well as making it possible to create an immigration system that works in the nationâs interests. Moreover, it will give Britain back control of its own borders.
48	The UK is taking on a remarkable journey by opting for independence, which is a rare occurrence and will require dedication. The pro-brexit argument is credible, and the World Trade Organization and European Union constitution have been provided as sources.
49	Death penalty cases are more expensive than non-death penalty cases due to the cost of housing prisoners in solitary confinement for the rest of their lives, as well as the cost of appeals. It is also possible that innocent people could be executed, which would violate the Eighth Amendment and result in a loss of public trust in the justice system.
50	The death penalty is an expensive form of punishment that has been demonstrated to have the potential to wrongly convict innocent people and may result in the execution of innocent people. It costs more than life in prison without parole to carry out a death sentence and is ultimately more costly than life in prison over the long run.
51	The death penalty is an effective deterrent for crime and has been proven to reduce crime rates in certain states. It is also cost effective and morally justified.
52	The death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes and helps to reduce crime overall. It also serves as a form of justice for the victims and their families, reduces overcrowding in prisons, and can instill fear in other potential criminals.
53	The death penalty is an effective punishment, as it decreases the prisoner population, prevents criminals from re-offending, and serves as a form of retribution. Additionally, it has been shown to act as a deterrent and is thus effective in reducing crime.
54	The death penalty is an expensive and inefficient use of taxpayer dollars because it costs more to execute an individual than to keep them in prison for life. Furthermore, the death penalty is applied unfairly and is not used often enough to have a significant deterrent effect on crime. Additionally, there's no guarantee that the death penalty will prevent criminal activity since innocent people have been executed in the past.
55	The death penalty is immoral because it involves depriving an individual of life for an offense and the risk of wrongful convictions could lead to an innocent person being executed.
56	The death penalty is more expensive than life imprisonment due to the cost of multiple appeals, additional court costs, and higher defense costs. Additionally, it carries the risk of executing innocent people, as has been seen in the past.
57	The death penalty provides justice to the victims and their families, and acts as a deterrent to potential criminal activity. It is supported by the majority of people, and its implementation helps to create a sense of justice and stability in society.
58	The death penalty should not be used as it is inhumane, costly and not an effective deterrent for murder. Life imprisonment is a more humane and cost effective way of punishing criminals, as it allows for rehabilitation and forgiveness while focusing on the victimsâ families.
59	Google is launching products such as Google Classroom and self-driving cars which, if widely adopted, could put all documents online, leading to the eventual death of paper. With this level of control over education and transport, Google would have immense power.
60	Google has been around for longer and receives more visitors than Bing, but Bing's market share is growing rapidly. Although a majority of people prefer Google, 33% of Google users said they would be using Bing more often after participating in tests.
61	Google is a reliable source and therefore pro must win. Con argued that Google is not a reliable source, but this is an assertion; Con has provided no evidence to contradict pro's argument.
62	Google is increasingly becoming unsafe for users due to its safety flaws, such as plagiarism and phishing. Additionally, its lack of protection for personal information has raised many concerns over privacy. Furthermore, Google Traffic View has been shown to cause an increase in traffic and road accidents, making it an unsafe tool for drivers.
63	Bing is not being acknowledged enough as a search engine, as people tend to favor Google due to its popularity and the lack of experience with Bing among its detractors. This is an unfair judgment as Bing offers numerous features and advantages that Google simply cannot compete with.
64	Google does not prevent results for "authorities on subjects" as long as the search query includes the relevant subject, which contradicts the claim that the argument on the right is invalid. Moreover, the issue is not that Google is a truth-selling authority but that it challenges existing authorities such as The Economist on economics, which again invalidates the argument.
65	Google has the financial backing and resources necessary to rank highly in search results or to protect copyrights and patents. Established authorities in various subject areas may prioritize defending their turf over being accessible to gullible children.
66	Google Glass opens up possibilities for reimagining how people learn and how tests are administered. It is the responsibility of educators to stay ahead of the curve and find inventive methods for students to absorb knowledge with the help of this technology.
67	Google's Review Rating System is flawed as it cannot guarantee safety, and a score of 100% is the criteria for success. Therefore, the system is inadequate.
68	Google+ has proven to be beneficial to users, as it has provided them with infinite characters for commenting and a free account that requires no harm to fill out. Furthermore, there has been no evidence presented to suggest that Google+ has caused any of the problems mentioned by the opposition. Therefore, it should remain integrated with YouTube.
69	Ethical vegans reject animal use and consumption of all animal-based products, while dietary vegans consume no animal food or dairy products. Veganism is a philosophy that goes beyond dietary choices and advocates for the abolishment of animal use.
70	Veganism is a lifestyle that rejects the exploitation of animals and abstains from animal-based products in food. Oral sex and swallowing semen are ethically acceptable within veganism, as it does not reduce the sender to a commodity.
71	A vegan diet is more efficient than an omnivorous diet in terms of acreage, animal agriculture is cruel, and a vegan diet takes less acreage. Additionally, a vegan diet helps to reduce world hunger, increases animal welfare, and is better for the environment.
72	Veganism goes against the natural order and could result in the slaughter of animals, as it is not practical for humans to stop eating something that has been part of our diet since the beginning of the human race. Humans are not the only ones who kill living beings, and forcing everyone to go vegan could put unnecessary strain on the planet's resources and impede sustainable development.
73	Hippopotamuses are vegetarian, but are vegan posers as they consume dairy and eggs but are not truly vegan. They are related to other two-toed animals like camels, cows, deer, and pigs, all of whom are vegetarian but not vegan.
74	Vegans are often seen as more compassionate and environmentally conscious than meat-eaters, but this argument suggests that vegans may be no more selfless or concerned than meat-eaters in terms of their impact on animals and the environment. Humans are selfish and careless with regards to the environment regardless of their dietary choices, meaning that vegans may not be any better than meat-eaters in terms of their environmental impact.
75	Veganism is an ethical lifestyle choice that aims to reduce animal suffering, decrease environmental harm, and promote human health. Many animal rights activists view veganism as the most ethical lifestyle choice as it has the least impact on animal lives.
76	Vegan women who swallow their partners' semen are hypocrites, as sperm is produced by humans and is an animal product. However, most women these days are not so prudish and are quite happy to enjoy their boyfriends' penile fluids.
77	Vegan women who swallow their boyfriend's semen are hypocrites because they are breaking their vow to not consume animal products, even though the boyfriend's semen is a high source of protein.
78	Vegetables are a source of essential nutrients that are lacking in meat, eggs, and dairy products. Most animals are in fact vegans, and vegetables provide the vitamins and minerals that meat-eating animals require.
79	Nuclear energy provides many benefits, such as its low cost of production which makes it economical, as well as the potential to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, its risks must not be neglected, such as creating radioactive wastes and posing threats to human health.
80	Nuclear energy offers many benefits, but it also has significant risks that make it unfeasible for much of the world. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are more cost effective and environmentally friendly alternatives, making them suitable for larger-scale deployment.
81	Nuclear power creates jobs, is cost effective, and has solutions for its nuclear waste issues. It is a reliable source of energy that has many economic and environmental benefits.
82	Nuclear energy has some benefits, such as efficiency, low carbon emissions and the potential for long-term savings in energy costs. However, it also has drawbacks, such as the potential for nuclear waste to be hazardous for thousands of years, and the potential for nuclear accidents to have catastrophic outcomes.
83	Nuclear energy has numerous risks associated with it, including the production of hazardous waste, high costs, potential dependence on foreign sources, and the possibility of accidents. In the UK, 200 million tons of radioactive waste are produced annually, which is both expensive and dangerous.
84	Nuclear energy is a reliable and cost-effective form of energy, as seen in its widespread usage in many countries around the world. The risks associated with its production are minimized when compared to the advantages it provides, as shown by the low rate of fatalities among workers in nuclear power plants.
85	Nuclear energy does not present an added threat to national security and is not as costly as asserted. Other countries have been proficient in mitigating risks associated with nuclear energy and the USA already has hundreds of nuclear weapons which are not used anyway.
86	Nuclear energy is not the way forward for the United States due to its inherent dangers and potential risks. Solar technology has been demonstrated to be a reliable and safer alternative that has been used for years. My opponent's claims regarding safety have been refuted.
87	Nuclear energy currently contributes 20% of the world's energy supply, but its potential can only rise to 20% due to the steady growth in demand. Additionally, the challenges of radioactive waste and early stage cooling mean that it cannot be a major part of the energy mix.
88	Nuclear energy is a promising source of energy that is efficient, sustainable and relatively cheap to produce, but it needs to be regulated and monitored carefully. Other sources of energy such as solar, wind, and hydro are renewable, sustainable, and clean.
89	Donald Trump is appealing to conservative Republicans and Independents with his promise to promote their beliefs if elected President. Whether or not his claims are genuine remains to be seen.
90	Donald Trump has had success in business, but his recent remarks in the presidential debates suggest that he may be lacking in certain stable qualities that are necessary for maintaining success. His declarations could lead to disaster if he were to lose his touch.
91	Donald Trump lacks the necessary experience and knowledge of politics to be an effective president. He has been accused of racism and sexism, and has refused to explain his policies in detail. His offensive comments about Mexicans and women, as well as his threats to tax China and make them pay for a wall, could have serious consequences for global relations.
92	Donald Trump has proven himself to be lacking in political experience, has made derogatory comments about various groups, such as Mexicans, women, and others, and has failed to provide concrete plans for replacing Obamacare. He is also a proven racist and sexist.
93	Donald Trump is working to gain high status within the Sith organization, which desires to overthrow the weak and rule with unrestricted power. He is criticizing weaker opponents like Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry in order to build support for himself, while also expressing strong hatred towards Mexican immigrants and wearing Sith robes and commanding a legion of soldiers.
94	Donald Trump is a racist and unscrupulous individual who taunts Native Americans, honors white supremacists, and may have plans to assassinate the current President of the United States. Allowing him to stay in power could lead to a highly divisive and xenophobic America. Voting for him is not a wise decision.
95	Donald J. Trump is not my president because he is an imaginary character that bears a striking resemblance to Donald J. Trump, but is nonetheless not the actual President of the United States. Even if I had specified which Trump I was referring to, it does not change the fact that he is an imaginary character, and thus not my president.
96	Donald Trump may be a successful businessman, but he lacks the necessary qualities to be an effective President. His policies have caused unrest among the US population, as they do not demonstrate empathy or humanity.
97	Donald Trump has been caught lying on numerous occasions, and his statements are often rated as false or "pants on fire" by fact-checkers such as Politifact.
98	Donald Trump is the only president who is speaking the truth and trying to make a difference, but no one is listening. The Democrats have been causing poverty across the world by manufacturing the virus, and Robert de Niro's comments prove he is just as wicked as Trump claims.
