0	Climate change is fake, according to sources such as http://www.globalclimatescam.com/, http://www.newsmax.com/, and https://en.wikipedia.org/, which show that exhaling Carbon Dioxide is no clear threat to our climate, that it is a conspiracy, and that there are no sources to back up the statement that climate change is real.
1	Climate change is occurring and is caused in part by human activities. This is supported by a scientific consensus and multiple studies, which report that 90-100% of climate scientists agree with this view.
2	Climate change is a man-made phenomenon that is supported by 97% of scientists and deniers of this fact have false arguments based on unsourced claims.
3	Climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious, and while some deniers may not notice the connection, they are real and serious.
4	Climate change is a real and urgent threat caused by human activity, and the majority of scientists agree on this. The evidence for this is overwhelming and can't be dismissed as a "fraud" without a much higher burden of proof.
5	1. We had dinner, games and a restaurant. 
6	Climate change is real and not a hoax, as it is proven by increased atmospheric CO2 levels due to human industrial activity, fluctuating temperature, and Arctic sea ice shrinking.
7	Climate change is an urgent issue that must be addressed, and those who dismiss it are simply wrong. The science of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and conclusive, as evidenced by the 97% consensus of climate scientists.
8	Anthropogenic climate change is real and caused in part by human activities, according to a common definition of anthropogenic which relates to, or results from human beings influencing nature. It is widely accepted by the scientific community that the Earthâ€™s atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including carbon dioxide.
9	Climate change is happening and is primarily caused by human activities. Burning fossil fuels is the main driver of this global phenomenon, and therefore we must take immediate action to protect our planet and ourselves.
10	Feminism, broadly defined, is the advocacy for women's rights and equality with men. There are several varieties of feminism, including Pink Hat feminism, which focuses on social, political, and economic equality between men and women.
11	Feminism is the act of advocating against woman abuse and everything which leads to women being slandered. It is not an act of feminism to defend a slut who enabled an adulterous man, as this would be counterproductive.
12	Pro has provided six authoritative sources stating that "feminism" is the movement for equality between men and women, while Con has not provided any source to back the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Therefore, Pro has successfully demonstrated that they are pro "feminism".
13	Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men, and this is a good thing. By this definition, you are a feminist.
14	Feminism is necessary to ensure gender equality in first world countries, and should not be abandoned once equality is achieved. Although equality has been achieved in some first world countries, inequality between the sexes still exists and feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed.
15	Feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but there must be progressive changes made before introducing it to deal with each conflict differently. Feminism is no longer needed in first-world countries like the US, but democracy and peace must reach these areas first.
16	Feminism focuses on women's rights and the belief that women should be prioritized and treated differently than men. Modern feminism has been found to be harmful and is toxic for society in general.
17	As an egalitarian, I believe that men and women should be treated equally, regardless of gender. I don't think it's right that men and women should be subject to different laws, or that prostate cancer should receive less funding than breast cancer, simply because of the gender of the patients.
18	Feminism is advocacy for women's rights, thus Pro is pro-feminism by definition. Pro also did not refute Observation 2 and Advantage 1, making Con the winner.
19	Feminism today is twisted and hypocritical, so it is best to abandon it and strive for equalism, which is for the rights of men and women.
20	Abortion should not be legal, as it can destroy lives and break apart families, and has dangerous risks for the mother. Furthermore, unborn babies should be protected by laws, and fetuses can feel pain, so abortion should not be an option.
21	Abortion should be legal in all cases, as it is the woman's right to choose what happens to her body. Some forms of abortion, such as partial birth abortion, should be avoided, but these should not be used to argue against legalizing abortion in general.
22	Abortion is a highly controversial practice, with some advocating for its termination in all cases, while others see it as a necessary evil in certain cases. Regardless, it is clear that the practice is not without its ethical, religious, and legal implications.
23	Abortion is a controversial topic, with many people taking either a pro-choice or pro-life stance. Those in favour of abortion argue that it is a woman's right to choose, while those against it believe that abortion goes against their religious or moral beliefs.  
24	Abortion is a controversial subject with many perspectives. Some people believe that it should be available in certain cases, while others are adamantly against it.
25	Abortion should remain legal as it helps to control population growth, prevents it from becoming too excessive, and stops China-like forced abortions from occurring. Additionally, it prevents the suicide rate of women from increasing.
26	Abortion should be accepted because medical, legal, illegal, and elective abortions have an impact on the decision of whether or not it should be accepted. The act of kicking a pregnant woman is not considered abortion as it is not deliberate, and thus immorality is not equivalent to abortion.
27	Pro-choice is correct in that it is not the role of the government to decide whether a woman has an abortion. Con's argument does not apply to pro-choice, as it is not the role of the government to force women to bear children they do not want or cannot afford.
28	Abortion should be legal as it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body, and making it illegal does not reduce the number of abortions but does increase maternal mortality. Women's lives, health and basic human rights depend on the availability of abortion, and these are the only factors that should be taken into consideration when evaluating the
29	Abortion should be morally acceptable if a fetus is not sentient, as determining morality by sentience is the most reasonable approach. On the other hand, personhood or non-personhood should be the determining factor for moral acceptability of abortion.
30	Trump cards, as defined by the first definition, do not have the ability to grow, change, etc. to separate plants and animals from things like water or rocks, nor do they have the ability to metabolize nutrients or show adaptation or response to environmental stimuli. Thus, Trump cards do not have life.
31	Trump's rhetoric is racist and dangerous, and will cause significant harm to the US by destroying communities, inciting hatred, and stopping social and economic progress. He should not be supported.
32	Donald Trump will make a great president because he is planning to build a wall on the southern border, fight ISIS, and strengthen the Christian religion. These policies will bring back jobs from China, Japan, Mexico and other countries, and bring back American money.
33	Trump has the potential to be a great president because he is a unifying leader and is not afraid to call out important issues. He also has realistic plans to reduce our debt, such as building a wall, that could stem the tide of illegal immigration and save money.
34	Donald Trump's stance on immigration is highly concerning and would lead to racist organizations like the Minutemen becoming more widespread if he were to become president. This would lead to more racial hatred, economic downturns, shattered communities, poor mental and physical health, and increased violence against immigrants, as evidenced by the example provided from Mexico.
35	Trump has changed his opinion on some issues, donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary Clinton in the past, and is not extremely religious. He has also been accused of using deceitful propaganda in his video.
36	Trump's outspokenness and bluntness make him an effective negotiator and a politician willing to speak candidly. He is tough on Islamic terrorism and will protect American interests.
37	Trump should not be the President of the world because he does not have the necessary qualifications to hold such an important position. Furthermore, his actions and decisions as President could potentially cause irreversible damage to the world.
38	Trump is just another politician who lies, and there's no reason to think he lies any more than any other politician. WashPo's list of lies is not comprehensive enough to draw meaningful conclusions about Trump's lying compared to other politicians.
39	Donald Trump is a liar who frequently makes false statements, while Hillary Clinton is a more honest candidate with a lower rate of falsehoods.
40	Brexit is likely to have a number of negative consequences, ranging from economic instability to diplomatic isolation, while providing few tangible benefits to the UK. This is likely to be a long and difficult process that will have implications for years to come.
41	The remain side had facts that Brexit would have little to no effect on the UK economy and would do nothing to affect immigration policy, while the Brexit side had rhetoric claiming Britain would benefit economically and gain control over its immigration policy. The facts show that Brexit would cost 6.3 billion pounds and could cost up to 6% of GDP, while immigration and autonomy would remain unchanged.
42	England's decision to leave the EU will be beneficial for the country since it will enable them to close their border to the migrant influx seen in other parts of Europe, keep a close eye on any illegal immigration from the Middle East, and save them millions in EU fees. Switzerland and Norway are examples of countries that are well-off and don't have to adhere to the regulations imposed by the bigger brother - the EU,
43	The British people are concerned about the security risks posed by open borders, and believe that Brexit is the best path for the UK to pursue its own economic interests. Other countries are considering following suit and withdrawing from the EU.
44	Britain should have control over its own borders and immigration policies, as it must be able to decide what is best for the British economy and people, not just Europe as a whole. Furthermore, Britain should have the right to determine the kind of policies it implements when dealing with migrants and refugees.
45	Leaving the EU would create considerable uncertainty for Indian businesses, possibly leading to a decrease in investment and movement of professionals, and could cause the volatility of the pound which could lead to increased risk for businesses in India.
46	England is struggling to make ends meet due to mass migration, yet establishing new industries may provide employment opportunities and trading relations that would improve the economy and quality of life.
47	Britain leaving the EU does not mean we will leave our collective effort with other countries on the war on terrorism. It is our concern that Brussels will force us to terms that will impact our community, particularly with regards to the public's sensitivity about muslims and terrorism.
48	The UK is taking a historical stance and embracing independence, which is rare and difficult to achieve. Despite this, the UK has the potential to prosper and become self-sufficient.
49	The death penalty is not an effective deterrent for crime and is much more expensive than imprisoning criminals for life. Additionally, there is a risk that innocent people could be executed, and the death penalty does not seem to deter crime more than the alternative punishment of life imprisonment.
50	The death penalty is more expensive than life in prison without parole due to its complexity and the possibility of wrongful executions.
51	The death penalty is expensive, uncertain, and open to errors, while life imprisonment is less costly and provides a more certain punishment. Furthermore, criminals may choose to ask for life instead of death because they know that death is not guaranteed and they can appeal a death sentence more easily.
52	The death penalty is an important deterrent that serves to provide justice, avenge victims, and prevent criminals from committing further crimes. Without the death penalty, prisons would become overcrowded with violent offenders and strikes against the government could occur, making society more dangerous.
53	The death penalty is a good idea because it reduces the prisoner population, saves tax payers money, prevents criminals from killing again, and is an effective deterrent.
54	The death penalty wastes taxpayer dollars, is applied unfairly, and can lead to the execution of innocent people.
55	The death penalty is flawed and immoral because it implies that a jury of 12 is not qualified to take a life, and also because it has the potential to lead to the wrongful execution of an innocent person.
56	The death penalty is an expensive form of punishment that carries the risk of executing innocent people, while life imprisonment is a cheaper alternative that does not put innocent lives at risk. Additionally, isolation and deprivation of human contact can drive prisoners to madness, making the death penalty a harsher punishment than life imprisonment.
57	The death penalty provides a sense of justice to victims' families and the public at large by punishing offenders with severe consequences. In the case of serial killers, the death penalty is the only sensible option as it protects society from further harm.
58	The death penalty should not be used because it brings little to no closure to families of victims, can be subject to mistakes, is expensive, does not deter crime, and encourages a fearful society. Life imprisonment is a better form of punishment as it allows for rehabilitation and focuses on the morality of the criminal instead of the vengeful emotions of society.
59	Google is releasing a variety of products that could potentially put all documents and paperwork online, giving them access to our data and the ability to manipulate our behavior. This could spell disaster for our freedom and our privacy, and one should be wary of such advancements in technology.
60	Google may have more visitors due to its longer existence, but this does not necessarily make it better than Bing. Additionally, the quote that Con provided of 33% of Google users saying they would be using Bing more often after taking part in the tests supports the argument that Bing is starting to catch up.
61	Google is a reliable source, and true so "pro must win". Con: googl said unreliable, but "reliable" not "reilable".
62	Google is acknowledged to have many safety flaws which indicates that its services are inadequate. Additionally, my opponent has failed to refute any points that I have made, indicating that they must concede this debate.
63	Bing isn't being properly evaluated because those who prefer Google to Bing are biased. This is because those who hate Bing often use Google and never use Bing, thus making it difficult to compare the two.
64	Google is protecting its assets and turf, just like every other existing company in the world. Startups need funds, investment leads to profit or loss, and those who can stave off risk and make smart choices and therefore profit win, while others lose out.
65	Google has been successful in attracting high-quality traffic from the newspapers' core demographic of "gullible children," allowing them to generate sizable profits. As such, newspapers are reluctant to directly challenge Google's dominance due to their lack of resources and the difficulty of competing in a highly competitive market.
66	Google Glass is a new technology that may not be a game-changer when it comes to cheating on tests. However, it is up to educators to find new methods of teaching that are still effective.
67	The Google Review System is bad because it promises absolute safety which is impossible, and can be exploited for malicious purposes.
68	Google+ integration with YouTube has been beneficial for both users and creators, as it has increased viewership and engagement on the platform. The only downside is that it requires a Google+ account to comment, but this is a minor inconvenience as it does not harm any users.
69	Going vegan would not only counter the effects of our evolutionary legacy, but would also disrupt the industries involved in the sale of animal-based foods, potentially damaging the economy. However, vegan-based products can provide all the same flavors and textures of non-vegan alternatives, without causing harm to non-human animals or impoverishing people overseas.
70	Vegans object to the commodification of animals and the exploitation of individuals, therefore vegans are entirely within their rights to practice oral sex as an expression of their ethics. Not only is spunk not a commodity, it is instead a marker of mutual respect and joy between two humans.
71	The resolution is that at least 99% of adult humans should eat vegan in the entire world.   Pro argues that veganism should be encouraged for the benefits it brings to human health, the environment, animal welfare, and the fight against world hunger.
72	The consumption of meat has been a part of human diet since the beginning of the human race, and forcing humans to defy the laws of nature and stop eating something that has been part of our diet would be wrong. Additionally, veganism might not be the best solution to animal cruelty, since animals like pigs would
73	Hippopotamuses are vegan, as they don't consume any animal products, but other animals like whales, porpoises, and pigs are carnivorous and therefore not vegan.
74	Meat eaters and vegans are both selfish and less caring due to our human nature, but vegans have chosen a diet that has a lower environmental impact. This makes vegans the more sensible and responsible choice.
75	The pleasure of eating animals is not wrong in itself, but it can be taken too far and become selfish and unethical. By taking the pleasure of eating animals too far, we are manipulating them to become dependent on us, which is unethical.
76	Most women nowadays are not prudish towards consuming their boyfriends' penile colada, but some of them are vegan and do so for ethical reasons. It is contradictory for vegan women to swallow their sires' semen since sperm is produced by humans, even though it is an animal product.
77	Vegetarian women who swallow their boyfriend's semen are hypocritical as they are knowingly breaking their vegetarian vow by consuming animal products. This goes against the spirit of socialism which is about removing antagonism between people, not perpetuating it.
78	Vegetables and fruits are an essential source of nutrients that are lacking in meat, and are necessary for a healthy, balanced diet. B12 supplements are available for vegans to ensure they receive the vitamins and minerals they need
79	Nuclear energy has strong economic, environmental, and safety advantages. It is a clean, safe, and economical source of energy that should not be discounted.
80	Nuclear energy has its advantages, but it also has many risks, such as the creation of toxic waste that is difficult to dispose of safely. Alternatives such as renewable energies, including wind, hydro, and solar, are more affordable and less risky than nuclear energy.
81	Nuclear energy has the potential to create jobs, reduce waste, and increase the economy, but its proponent has forgotten that this is a debate about whether or not other forms are good, not just that nuclear power is good. Fusion reactors are rapidly approaching which not only gets rid of nuclear waste, but also creates more power, and the space elevator is only 2-4 decades away which will drastically reduce the amount of time nuclear waste needs to be stored for.
82	Nuclear energy is a controversial form of energy production as it has both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, it is a cleaner and more efficient form of energy production than other methods such as coal.
83	Nuclear energy has a number of drawbacks, including waste production, high cost, dependency and the risk of accidents. Waste production is a major issue as the UK produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, which is both costly and presents a risk to the environment.
84	Nuclear energy is an important part of America's energy future. It is a reliable and cost-effective source of energy that produces less carbon emissions than other forms of energy production.
85	Nuclear energy is an efficient and cost-effective way to generate energy, as any serious investor would not put their money into something that does not give profits greater than what is put in.
86	Nuclear energy is not the way forward for the United States; solar technology has been proven successful and developments in the field are widely known, nuclear waste cannot be stored near water sources, and increasing nuclear energy will take too long.
87	Nuclear energy production has been linked to increased radiation and health problems in Belarus and has limited efficiency in producing energy due to its high cost and inability to be scaled up to meet increasing demands.
88	Wind energy is a viable alternative energy source that can serve as a stopgap measure until we develop more reliable sources of power, but it is not nearly powerful enough to serve as the primary energy source for a large city. Nuclear energy has the potential to be an extremely efficient, renewable source of power, but it carries with it the potential for catastrophic failure and must be rigorously regulated to ensure public safety.
89	Donald Trump has been gaining a lot of support from the conservative and independent crowds because he's promising to promote the things that they believe in. Despite his support, some have questioned whether he's genuine in his beliefs or simply a "Spoiler" taking away votes from more established candidates.
90	Donald Trump is a successful businessman, but he may lose his touch. He has unstable qualities such as declaring himself god, and he hasn't addressed why we should bomb Iraq and Syria.
91	Donald Trump is a racist, sexist and inexperienced candidate who doesn't explain things and has offensive opinions about women and Mexicans. He has no political experience and is unfit to be President of the United States.
92	Donald Trump is unsuitable for President of the United States because he has no political experience, is racist and sexist, hasn't explained his positions or plans, said he'd replace Obamacare with "something terrific" but hasn't explained how
93	Donald Trump is endeavoring to achieve great power by dismantling weaker candidates and tearing down the current leadership of the United States. He wishes to do so by utilizing the Sith's kratocratic methods of force and cunning, and is inspiring hatred towards immigrants and the Jedi in order to accomplish his goals.
94	Donald Trump is a racist and a liar who teases Native Americans and thinks white supremacists are heroes. Unless you want Trump to turn the United States into a land of oppression and fear, it is important to stand against him.
95	Donald Jackleberry Trump is not my president because he is an imaginary character, and thus not eligible to hold the office.
96	Donald Trump may have economic benefits, but he lacks the humanity necessary to be an effective President of the United States. He has already caused protests and is not a good role model for citizens, promoting inequality and lack of kindness.
97	The election of Donald Trump would likely be the death of the American Dream. To stop this, Hillary Clinton must be successful in the Democratic primary race and supporters of the American Dream must work to ensure her victory.
98	Donald Trump is the only president who is trying to make a difference and speaking the truth, yet nobody is listening. The Democrats and the rest of the world has put us into poverty but we don't pay attention to him.
