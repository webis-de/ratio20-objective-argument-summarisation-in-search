0	Climate change is a hoax, as evidenced by the sources provided. Exhaling Carbon Dioxide is no clear threat to our climate, and our cars do it too.
1	A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so.
2	Climate change is an undeniable reality and human activity is the primary cause of it. Scientists agree that 97% of the causes of global warming are due to mankind's actions.
3	Climate change poses a serious risk to the future of the Earth and mankind. The threats it brings can be insidious and the connection with some others not immediately noticed by deniers.
4	I accept this challenge. First, I should ask to be clear: When you say "climate change is a fraud," are you referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change or all climate change?
5	The climate is not changing. The local weather may change but the global climate stays basically the same.
6	Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said.
7	I propose that climate change is a real and urgent threat and that those who deny its existence are spreading false information. The science of human-caused climate change is sound and based on accurate data.
8	The task at hand is to contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent. From a common definition, anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature.
9	Climate change is an ongoing political debate that deniers try to make look like a scientific one. The science, however, is settled, with a 97% consensus that human activities are the main cause of global warming and
10	Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun!
11	Feminism is a movement dedicated to fighting against woman abuse, and everything that leads to the slandering of women. It is not an act of feminism to defend a slut who enabled an adulterous man, as this would be counter-productive.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. Con's presented only one argument in this entire debate - that masculinism is male supremacy, therefore feminism is female supremacy - without giving any evidence to back the claim that
13	Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men, and it is a movement to ensure those rights are upheld. In spite of its name, feminism does not discriminate against men, but instead seeks to create a world where both genders are treated equally.
14	Feminism is an argument that is necessary in some places, such as first world countries, to ensure equality between the sexes. It is an ongoing movement that aims to help maintain equality and spread the ideology of equality to other parts of the world where help is needed.
15	Feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but the conditions of the countries' economy and social interaction must be taken into consideration. Slow, progressive changes should be made to address each conflict differently and ensure that feminism is welcomed before it is implemented.
16	Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points.
17	Equality is important for everyone, regardless of gender. Feminism is a movement focused on achieving equality for women, but egalitarianism is the belief that everyone should be treated equally.
18	Feminism is the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. Con conceded that Pro was pro equal rights, thus Pro conceded that Pro is pro feminism, as this is the definition of feminism.
19	Feminism today is so distorted and hypocritical that it is best to abandon it. I am for the rights of men and women, not just women, and not only men.
20	Mother Teresa said, "The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me? There is nothing between."
21	Abortion should be legal and available in all cases, since it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. In the case of rape or incest, abortion can provide necessary closure and allow women to move on with their lives.
22	-ABORTION- Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death.[1] An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species.
23	- ABORTION - Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death. An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species.
24	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death. An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species.
25	Abortion is needed to control the population and prevent it from becoming too excessive. If we do not make use of abortion in the 22nd century, the population is estimated to reach 11.2 billion people - a figure that is unsustainable.
26	Abortion can be defined as the deliberate termination of a pregnancy after conception, usually performed during the first twenty weeks of gestation. In general, people classify abortion into four categories, which are therapeutic, elective, clinical, and criminal
27	Abortion has both positives and negatives, but instead of discussing these, Con has simply stated that abortion "enslaves" people into paying for their abortions. Con would be fine with this if the woman has to pay for her own abortion?
28	Most people who want to make abortion illegal are motivated by a lack of understanding and emotion. Research shows that prohibiting abortion does not reduce the number of abortions, but rather increases the risk of maternal mortality.
29	This isn't your typical abortion debate. Because I've never had the 'opportunity' of being a pregnant lady, nor do I have the privilege of remembering my fetus days, I don't consider myself fit to actually judge as to whether abortion is OK or not.
30	Trump is not life, as it does not meet any of the seven qualifications needed for something to have life. It lacks the ability to maintain balanced conditions, show adaptation to the environment, and reproduce itself.
31	Trump's racist rhetoric is dangerous and will destroy the US. It destroys communities, causes crime, and harms people physically, mentally, and emotionally.
32	Here is the source I will be using: https://www.todaysinfo.net/news/trump-13-reasons-will-make-great-president.html  Trump has a plan to build a wall to stop illegal immigration, to fight ISIS, and to strengthen the Christian religion. This will make him the greatest president of all time.
33	First of all, why do you think Mr. Trump will be such a "great" president? He is an inconsiderate jerk who thinks that he can say all the crap he likes to say about people and get away with it.
34	Trump's stance on immigration is dangerous and could cause widespread racism and violence. He will encourage organizations like the Minutemen, which have been shown to hunt down and kill immigrants, both legal and illegal.
35	Despite some changes in his views, Trump has largely stayed consistent in his policies. He is currently in favor of a market-based system for healthcare and has notably donated to and supported Bill and Hillary Clinton in the past.
36	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump, as he is not afraid to speak his mind and has the negotiation skills necessary to reach successful outcomes. Furthermore, Trump's business acumen and blunt attitude make him an ideal leader.
37	I accept. Before we begin I would like to clear some things up for the voters and provide definitions.
38	In round 2, I demolished everyone's source that Trump is a liar: WashPo's list is full of clearly non-lies. Probably nothing on their list is a real lie.
39	Trump frequently speaks untruths and has difficulty stopping himself. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is more likely to tell the truth.
40	Given that the British people have voted to leave the EU, and that the UK is now invoking Article 50, I hope that the consequences of Brexit will be mostly positive. My opponent has not yet made any arguments as to why Brexit will be beneficial, so I shall refrain from expanding my arguments this round.
41	Leaving the EU would not have a significant economic impact on the UK, as the cost of EU membership is only 0.3% of GDP and Britain earns 13% of its GDP from exports to the EU. Moreover, economists predict that the UK could lose up to 6% of GDP from leaving the EU, which is greater than 0.3%.
42	England will benefit from Brexit, as they will be able to close their borders to the influx of migrants, while keeping a close eye on illegal immigration from the Middle East. Additionally, Brexit will save England millions in EU fees, similar to what Switzerland and Norway have done.
43	The UK is better off outside the EU, as evidenced by the success of Switzerland and Norway, which are not part of the EU. The migrant crisis is a direct result of open borders, as seen in the rest of Europe, and Brexit offers the UK an opportunity to control its own borders and secure its own interests.
44	Britain's economic and political ties with Europe have been historically strong, yet the current state of affairs have changed drastically due to the EU's financial troubles and other factors. Britain should remain in the EU for its own economic and political interests.
45	My opponent has fallen into a logical fallacy known as a "bare assertion" fallacy. This is when someone makes a claim without providing any substantiation.
46	England is facing a lot of trouble due to migration, leading to a rise in unemployment, which is affecting people's quality of life. This could be remedied by leaving the EU and establishing new trading relationships with other countries, which would create employment opportunities.
47	The UK has been a member of the European Union for too long and it's time for a change. Leaving the EU would enable the UK to strike its own trade deals and could save money in the long-run.
48	My opponent's debating technique is terrible. I posted a lot of evidence and even provided sources for it, but my opponent is refusing to look at it, claiming it is unreliable.
49	The death penalty is an expensive and ineffective form of punishment that does not deter crime, and should be abolished. Furthermore, there is a risk of wrongful executions due to its flawed nature, and innocent people could be executed if the death penalty is reinstated.
50	The death penalty has been shown to be more expensive than life in prison without parole, with costs escalating over time. Evidence suggests that death penalty cases cost between 2-10 times more than equivalent LWOP cases over time.
51	Arguments in favor of the death penalty: 1. It deters crime – Studies have found that the threat of the death penalty is a deterrent for potential criminals, as they fear the ultimate consequence for their actions.  
52	The death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes and serves as an appropriate form of punishment for those who have committed heinous acts. It decreases jail overpopulation, puts fear into other criminals, and avenges innocent lives.
53	The death penalty is a good idea because it reduces the prisoner population, prevents criminals from killing again, and is an effective deterrent. This is evidenced by a chart which documents the number of homicides and executions from 1950 to 2002.
54	The death penalty is an effective form of punishment for certain crimes, but it is expensive and has been known to cause wrongful executions. In some cases, it is not applied uniformly and can serve as a source of intimidation rather than a deterrent to crime.
55	The death penalty is immoral because it makes a false assumption that a jury of twelve can take life, and is irreversible if someone is wrongly convicted, with the potential of an innocent person being killed. Life in prison is certainly a more humane alternative.
56	Death penalty cases are more expensive than non-death penalty murder cases due to the need for extensive appeals and various other expenses, as demonstrated by a study from deathpenaltyinfo.org. This means that it is more cost-effective to imprison an individual for the rest of their life than to put them to death.
57	The death penalty is supported by some as an effective deterrent for crime, as well as a form of justice to be served on convicted offenders. It is argued that if offenders know they will face capital punishment if caught, they may be less likely to commit a crime.
58	The death penalty is inhumane, expensive, and not an effective deterrent to crime. Life imprisonment provides more closure for families of victims, offers the chance of rehabilitation, and is cheaper than the death penalty.
59	Google is relentlessly expanding its presence in our lives, from releasing Google Classroom and Google Cars to having the ability to control everything through Google Fiber. This could lead to a future where our food and purchases are monitored
60	Google gets an average of 188 Million visitors a day, while Bing gets a measly 60 million a day. This may indicate that Google is the superior search engine, since it has been around longer and has more established user loyalty.
61	1. Google is a reliable source.  
62	My opponent has failed to refute any point that I have made, therefore I am led to believe that he is conceding this debate. If Google was really the best search engine, why would there be things such as phishing, traffic view, and safety flaws?
63	Google has a large following due to bias amongst its users. This bias exists because those who prefer Google are typically those who have not used or are not aware of the features offered by Bing.
64	Google does not block results for "Authorities on subjects" if someone wants an article from the New Scientist, meaning that the original argument is flawed. Furthermore, the issue may not be that Google is an ultimate truth-selling authority, but rather that it challenges existing and established authorities, such as The Economist on Economics.
65	Google is the winner in the newspapers' battle as it is able to offer better services and charge higher prices due to its strong position. Established authorities can compete with it for top slots if they wish, or they can be content with their existing positions and protect copyright/patents instead.
66	Google Glass presents an opportunity to rethink the way we learn, as it is another way for people to potentially cheat on tests. It is the responsibility of educators to adapt to these new technologies and find effective methods of learning that use Google
67	The Google Review System is bad because it cannot guarantee safety, And good and bad are the measurement of success.
68	Even though the debate is to stop something, my opponent is clearly taking the pro side to this, and I will be arguing that Google+ should stay integrated with YouTube.    Decrease viewers and subscribers: How so?
69	The consumption of animal products has been linked to various health issues, and going vegan has been shown to counter the effects of our evolutionary adaptations to a carnivorous diet. Additionally, veganism destroys the industries involved in the sale of animal products, which could mess up the economy.
70	Veganism is the practice of abstaining from animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals. The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes.
71	Veganism should be adopted by at least 99% of adult humans worldwide to ensure both a healthy and sustainable lifestyle for both humans and the environment. Animal happiness, world hunger, and the environment are all greatly improved when veganism is practiced.  
72	Bacon and steak are not really bacon and steak without the meat that goes into them. Plus, getting rid of the meat industry entirely would be different than transitioning from milk to soy (more milk is sold than soy anyways).
73	Hippopotamuses are vegan, as they only eat grasses, water plants, and other non-animal foods. Additionally, camels and cows are vegan, as they both have cousins (llamas and alpacas, respectively) that are also vegan.
74	Vegans and meat-eaters are both capable of being selfish and less caring due to our shared human nature, but vegans are better and smarter because they make a choice to reduce their harm to animals and the environment. Eating vegan does not make one inherently better or smarter, but it does align them with a cause that is designed to be beneficial to all living creatures and the planet we inhabit.
75	Veganism is not the only way to reduce animal suffering; other practices such as reducing meat consumption, avoiding animal tested products and supporting sustainable fishing initiatives can also help reduce animal suffering. Animals are fellow Earthlings and should be treated with respect and compassion regardless of whether or not they are seen as “food”.
76	Some of the more prim and proper women consider ingesting Harry Monk to be a common, vulgar practice: unbecoming of a lady and, therefore, they refuse to imbibe such testicular tinctures. However, most women these days aren't so prudish and are quite happy to quaff their boyfriends' penile colada.
77	Marx wrote that ‘The average population, however, does not as yet spend its vital energy in political struggles, but expends it in the most important and extensive struggles, the economical struggles of supply and demand’. This suggests that, in order to achieve a successful, equitable and progressive society, we must tackle our economic problems first and foremost.
78	It's funny that such arguments would come from a person who only feeds their dog vegetables. You use the term "animals" as though all animals are omnivores.
79	Nuclear energy has many benefits economically, as it produces highly efficient energy with low operating costs. However, the cost of building a nuclear power plant is high, and we should be mindful of the resources we use in constructing it.
80	Nuclear energy is an attractive source of energy as it is an efficient, affordable and cleaner alternative to traditional energy sources. Unfortunately, its toxic waste presents a major environmental threat and makes it prohibitive for much of the world.
81	Nuclear power provides significant economic benefits due to its low cost and the long lifespans of its workers, and these benefits are only further amplified by the nearing development of fusion reactors which will eliminate the radioactive waste issue. Solar power is a viable alternative but does not possess the same level of economic potential as nuclear power.
82	Nuclear energy has many benefits in comparison to other forms of energy production. It produces less air pollution than coal and other fossil fuels, it is efficient, and it has the potential to be a much cheaper form of energy production.
83	The use of nuclear energy should be limited due to four main reasons: waste, cost, dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste annually, which is a problem.
84	Nuclear energy is the safest and most efficient way to power a nation. The low death toll from nuclear accidents and the lack of environmental damage from nuclear waste are advantages that make it the better choice compared to other sources of energy.
85	As already admitted, there are cons to nuclear, as there are cons to all sources. At least with nuclear, we aren't destroying the atmosphere.
86	In this round, my opponent again misrepresented my arguments either deliberately or inadvertently. He claimed that solar technology is unproven, although it has been proven for years.
87	Nuclear energy is an important part of the energy mix, but it presents many challenges. First, opponent must look back to my round 2 argument, where I proved carbon is released earlier in the production process.
88	Wind energy is the best available energy source because it is renewable, sustainable and produces a lot of power. Nuclear energy is an excellent alternative as it is cheap, reliable and produces almost limitless energy.
89	Donald Trump is a businessman who is appealing to disgruntled conservatives and independents. He is touted as a conservative, but some suggest he may be a spoiler who is taking votes away from other Republican candidates.
90	Donald Trump is a successful businessman, but what happens when he loses his touch? I've done some research and found that he has some unstable qualities.
91	Donald Trump lacks political experience, is racist and sexist, and hasn't provided a clear plan for replacing Obamacare or addressing US-China trade relations. He has made inflammatory remarks about Mexico and women, and his proposed policies could jeopardize US-Mexico relations and 2 million US jobs.
92	Donald Trump has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and does not explain his plans in sufficient detail. He has said he will replace Obamacare with "something terrific", but what exactly?
93	Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power - one of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruction. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power.  
94	Dear The Conservative Socialist,  Donald Trump is racist and a liar who mocks Native Americans and thinks white supremacists are heroes. Voting for him is a terrible idea and we must stand against him.
95	Donald Jackleberry Trump is not my president because he is an imaginary character. Any person with common sense would be able to know that I meant he would lose the debate by accepting.
96	Donald Trump may be a successful businessman, but he lacks the necessary empathy and humanity required to be an effective President of the United States. His policies have been met with protests, including the Women's March, which shows he is not fit to lead the world's largest economy.
97	Donald Trump is a liar who often has trouble telling the truth, while Hillary Clinton is mostly truthful in her statements.
98	Donald Trump is the only President who is speaking truth and trying to fix the mess the Democrats and the rest of the world have created. Unfortunately, no one is listening to him and allowing him to continue his work.
