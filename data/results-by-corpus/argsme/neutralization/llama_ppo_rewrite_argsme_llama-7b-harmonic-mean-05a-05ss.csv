0	Climate change clearly does not exist, here are reasons why: (1) Exhaling Carbon Dioxide is no clear threat to our climate, we just breathe it out, our cars do it too (2) It is a conspiracy (3) There are no sources to back your statement up Here are my sources on how "Climate Change" doesn't exist:  (1) http://www.globalclimatescam.com... (2) http://www.newsmax.com... (3) https://en.wikipedia.org...  These 3 sources tell you that climate change is fake, first one tells you the top 10 reasons why climate change does not exist, the second, facts about this "global warming" hoax; And finally, The third source tells you the entire conspiracy that "Climate Change exists" that carbon dioxide is not a cause for concern, that our cars are also a factor in climate change and that the climate is affected by other factors as well.
1	A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. According to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper, 90-100% of publishing climate scientists agree that humans are causing recent global warming. The consensus is also consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al. which states that man-made climate change is extremely likely to exist.
2	My position on climate change is that not only do I believe in it but I believe it is primarily man-caused. According to sources, 97% of scientists believe that climate change is primarily human-caused. Human-caused climate change deniers' arguments are not fact-driven. I wish my opponent the best of luck.

3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and not immediately noticed, but they are real and serious. Among them are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as the Zika virus, which will extend across North America and Europe. Climate change is caused by human activity, and it is this human activity that is causing it to accelerate. The 1st Amendment does not protect child pornography, which can be banned to prevent harm to children from its production. The danger of climate change is too great to allow this ignorance to continue to be peddled. Yes, if need be, imprisonment of those who spread false information about climate change should be considered.
4	I will accept this challenge. First, I would like to clarify that when I say "climate change is a fraud", I am referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change. If it is the case that the globe is warming at an unprecedented rate, I'd be happy to go into the evidence for it. Moreover, "fraud" implies more than just the majority of scientists being wrong (i.e. Misinterpreting the evidence) - it also implies that they are intentionally lying. I will review the evidence for anthropogenic climate change over the next 72 hours.
5	Climate change is a complex scientific issue and it is understandable that people have different views on the matter. The science shows that the climate is indeed changing, with the global temperature increasing, sea levels rising, and the oceans absorbing more heat. The IPCC is a legitimate and trustworthy international organization that has researched and assessed the scientific evidence on climate change, and its reports present an accurate and detailed summary of the science. The causes of climate change are mostly human-induced, with the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities producing greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.  1. The primary cause of climate change is increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide which traps more heat in the atmosphere, leading to warming. 2. The oceans absorb more heat when they absorb more human-emitted carbon dioxide, so the ocean warms more slowly than the atmosphere does.  3. The 97% consensus is that human-caused climate change is happening, and the scientific evidence for this comes from multiple lines of evidence. 4. There is robust evidence that climate change is caused by human activities, with the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities producing greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere being the main cause. 5. Natural variability and changes in solar radiation also have an effect on climate change.  The satellite data and other observations show that the Earth's overall temperature is increasing, and this is leading to more extreme weather events. Sea levels are also rising, and the oceans are absorbing more heat, which is trapping more heat in the atmosphere. The oceans absorb more heat when they absorb more human-emitted carbon dioxide, so the ocean warms more slowly than the atmosphere does.  1.

6	Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real.  Increasing levels of atmospheric CO2, increase temperatures, and rise 1"C since 1969, This might not seem like much, but in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7"F,  Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. Climate change is indeed real, Not a hoax. Climate change is a natural process, But the rate at which it is currently occurring is greatly accelerated by human industrial activity.
7	I propose that climate change is a real and urgent threat. The science of human-caused climate change is sound and full of evidence and calculations that show the effects of greenhouse gases on the Earth's atmosphere and temperature. The effects of human-caused climate change are mathematically and physically impossible to reach 80 parts / million of CO2 and be effective in terms of temperature, as shown by scientists. 4. Maurice Strong is the main person that started this whole climate push and was found to be corrupt but the Chinese government gave him amnesty. 5. Climate data is accurate but some countries, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, have refused to share all the data. The fact that these countries are major oil and gas producers raises questions about their data. That said, the data that is available provides a good overview of global climate trends.  The consensus of climate scientists is that 97% agree that human-caused climate change is real and that the effects of human-caused climate change can be seen in the data. 3. The IPCC reports have been rigorously reviewed and approved by governments. 2. The publication of the IPCC reports are carefully vetted by the press. One example is the In-depth Assessment of the IPCC 2007 report which was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with the IPCC. This report, and the other assessments, are based on a vast body of research that is available to anyone who wishes to check it.  If the effects of human-caused climate change are modeled with detailed computer programs, the results are eerily close to real observations." This process of modeling shows that the effects of human-caused climate change can be seen in the data. The computer models also show that the Earth's atmosphere is able to reach a temperature of 80 parts / million of CO2 and be effective in terms of temperature. 4. The IPCC's 2007 report was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with the IPCC. This report, and the other assessments, are based on a vast body of research that is available to anyone who wishes to check it.  The science behind climate change is sound and the 2007 report includes a clear and convincing summary of the science. 3. The IPCC reports are widely accepted by governments and the press as accurate representations of the science. 2. The 2007 IPCC report won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with the IPCC. This report, and the other assessments, are based on a vast body of research that is available to anyone who wishes to check it.

Assumption (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (0.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be on sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The sources of CO2 emissions from mankind is 3.62%, which is a very small percentage. From a logical point of view, it is hard to believe that such a small percentage could be the cause of a global warming. However, man's contribution of 3.62% of CO2 emissions is still a factor. It is impossible to pinpoint a single source of emissions that is responsible for the climate change. Carbon dioxide emissions from mankind is responsible for only a portion of the global warming. The majority of CO2 emissions from mankind are relatively insignificant in terms of causing global warming. The alarmists will use certain thresholds in parts per million (ppm) to try and link the source of emissions to climate change. 400 ppm sounds scary and 0.04% is a very small amount, but the level of CO2 emissions from mankind is still a factor. It is difficult to believe that such a small amount of emissions could be the cause of a global warming.  Climate change is a factor influenced by many different sources of emissions from nature as well as mankind. Carbon dioxide emissions from mankind is only responsible for a portion of the global warming. From a logical standpoint, it is impossible to pinpoint any single source of emissions as being the cause of the climate change. Carbon dioxide emissions from mankind makes up only a portion of the global warming, and it is difficult to say that man's contribution of 3.62% of CO2 emissions is the cause of the global warming.  The majority of the carbon dioxide emissions from mankind are only a contributing factor to the climate change.

9	Round two arguments. First, the science is settled, this is a political debate that deniers try to make look like a scientific debate. Fact: There is a 97% consensus on climate change. Climate scientists are the experts of experts in their field. A consilience of evidence, social calibration, and social diversity exist. Myth: 31,000 scientists signed a petition so therefore there is no consensus. Fallacy: Fake experts, as the expertise increases so does agreement. Co2 is at the highest it has been in over 800,000 years. Tempatures are rising. Glaciers are overall losing mass. Humans fingerprints show humans are extremely likely to be causing these events. Burning of fossil fuels and the released Co2 is the main driver of climate change.  The evidence suggests that CO2 is at its highest concentration in 800,000 years, and temperature and glacier melting point to humans as the main cause of climate change.
10	Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate I do not pretend to stand for all of feminism seeing as there are many different sects of the movement. I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. Additionally, I think feminism has gone too far in devaluing pornography, which can be seen as a form of art. Feminism should not try to do away with it entirely, but rather strive to do away with the dehumanization of women in pornography.   In regards to the Pink Hat movement, I do not agree with it. I believe that women should seek to raise their own visibility and value without having to compare themselves to men. Feminism should advocate for the recognition of women's activities and achievements on an equal level with those of men.  My stance is that feminism has gone too far in devaluing pornography, which can be seen as a form of art. Feminism should not try to do away with it entirely, but rather strive to do away with the dehumanization of women in pornography.  In addition, I think feminism has gone too far in trying to enforce strict standards of equality between men and women. Women should seek to raise their own visibility and value without having to compare themselves to men. Feminism should advocate for the recognition of women's activities and achievements on an equal level with those of men.  I also do not agree with the Pink Hat movement. Instead, I believe that women should seek to make their own activities and achievements more visible and valued.  Feminism needs to advocate for equal recognition of women's activities and achievements on an equal level with those of men.  Feminism has gone too far in trying to enforce strict standards of equality between men and women. I believe that women should seek to raise their own visibility and value without having to compare themselves to men. Additionally, Feminism should not seek to enforce strict standards of equality between gender roles, but rather strive to reduce gender-based obstacles that prevent equal access to activities and achievements.  Feminism should advocate for equal recognition of women's activities and achievements on an equal level with those of men.

11	Feminism has no gender. I am a man and I am a feminist. Feminism by definition stands up for all my perspectives, ambitions, desires and behaviors. Feminism is the act of advocating against woman abuse, and everything which leads to women being slandered - including false propaganda about feminism by sluts who enable sexist men. I am pro-feminism, and I believe in the power of feminism to make a difference.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. Con's presented only one argument in this entire debate that "Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women". Without providing any source of definition for Feminism, Con's argument is not sound. I have offered six authoritative sources stating that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women. I am for Feminism. According to Con, Con is an "equalist" and is "for the rights of men AND women". Therefore, Con is also for Feminism.
13	You are right, feminism is difficult to define, as it covers a range of ideas. I would say that feminism is the idea that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. If you look at it through the lens of the mission statement, you think that feminists are not only trying to make men and women equal, but that they are also trying to remove the bias towards men. If you think that trying to remove the bias against men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end, if you are a feminist, you think that feminists are trying to make sure that men and women are treated equally and not stereotyped. Men's rights activists are critical of the way that feminism goes about trying to achieve this, saying that feminists are too focused on women and not enough on men. Equality is the doctrine of feminism - not female supremacy. But, there is a sense that feminists are trying to make sure that women are better represented in society, and that this representation is not to the detriment of men. Equality does not just focus on legislation, but also on media representation and stereotypes.   Regarding the matter of false rape accusations, as a feminist, I think it is a terrible thing to occur, but if it does happen, it should not be a problem. You can look at it through the lens of the mission statement and say that false rape reports are not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur. False rape accusations are a rare occurrence, and as a feminist, I think that feminists are not trying to call the police on something like this.

What you say about false rape accusations is correct - they are a rare occurrence, and as a feminist, I think feminists are not trying to call the police on something like this. What I am trying to say is that, as a feminist, I think false rape reports are not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur. As a feminist, I think feminists are trying to make sure that women are better represented in society, and that this representation is not to the detriment of men. Equality does not just focus on legislation, but also on media representation and stereotypes. A feminist is looking for equality in all aspects. Men's rights activists are critical of the way that feminism goes about trying to achieve this, saying that feminists are too focused on women and not enough on men. As a feminist, I believe that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities. If you look at it from the mission statement of feminism, you believe that men and women should have equal rights and that the gender roles should not define how they are treated. In terms of gender roles, feminists think that the traditional views of gender should not be reinforced.  With regard to the matter of gender identity, as a feminist, I think gender identity should not be a determining factor when it comes to how people are treated. A feminist believes that gender identity should not be a deciding factor when it comes to equal rights and opportunities. Feminism believes that everyone should be treated the same irrespective
14	In this debate, I have argued that feminism is still necessary in first world countries like the USA. My opponent concedes that it should not be necessary in some places, yet he does not provide any sources to show that feminism has been successful in some of these places. He also offers no explanation as to why feminism should eventually disappear once success has been found in first world countries. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that my opponent has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me the debate. My original argument was that feminism is still necessary in first world countries like the USA. Equality has been achieved in terms of some basic rights, but feminism is still important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Con has provided no sources to show that equality now fully exists in some of these places, nor has he provided a decent explanation as to why feminism should eventually disappear once success has been found in some of these countries.  The success of the fight for equality in some of these countries has been limited by the fact that feminism is still necessary to help maintain that equality.
15	I agree with you that feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but you must consider the conditions of the countries economy and social interaction because such a movement could cause unrest if it were to spread too quickly. Slow, progressive changes must be made to achieve change in these countries. Feminism may not be needed in 1st world countries like the US, but first democracy and peace must reach these areas for these laws to be made. Many of these middle eastern countries make these laws due to Islamic influence, which states that husbands have some control over their wives. It is misinterpretation of Islam that gives these countries the idea that husbands must have control over their wives. If these countries had democracy and peace, feminism could be more easily implemented.
16	Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. First off, I reject your definition of feminism. I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism. I also reject your premise, because I stated in my first argument that MODERN feminism is harmful. My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes. Third-wave feminism was more focused on challenging traditional gender roles, rather than advocating for legislation and legal rights, which is what second-wave feminism did. I don't think you have won this debate. Maybe I am wrong though. Maybe you can prove yourself in the second round. Good luck.   Secondly, I will prove that women were not given the right to vote in some states until 1920.   The source for women's suffrage in some states being granted in 1919 is the book "When Men Win: The Toll of War on Manhood and Womanhood in the American Civil War South" by W. Todd Grover. According to this source, some states gave women the right to vote in 1920, for example, Alabama did so in 1919, but other states such as Wyoming and Colorado gave women the right to vote in 1919. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0FULAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=When+Men+Win%3A+The+Toll+of+War+on+Manhood+and+Womanhood+in+the+American+Civil+War+South+by+W.+Todd+Grover&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjAv6k6h9vUAhVG44MKHZj3AhE4HhDoAQgKMAU#v=onepage&q&f=false.   }   The source for women's suffrage in some states being granted in 1919 is the book "When Men Win: The Toll of War on Manhood and Womanhood in the American Civil War South" by W.

17	Hi everyone I'm Ilan and I am not a feminist. I believe that everyone should be equal, not just women. I do not identify as a feminist because I think that feminism should not just be about women. I am an egalitarian, believing that everyone should be treated equally regardless of gender. One major issue that both men and women face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer, but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. Men's health issues, including prostate cancer, are not addressed as much by feminism as women's issues are. This is not fair, as cancer affects everybody regardless of gender. I think that everyone should be able to campaign for their own health issues, not just women's health issues.
18	In response to Observation 2 and Advantage 1, Pro stated that all my evidence was about equal rights, not feminism. However, this argument is flawed. A quick Google search indicates that feminism, by its very definition, means equal rights to women. Additionally, Observation 2 and Advantage 1 were untouched in the last round, which is reason to vote for con. In conclusion, by the definition of feminism, Pro conceded that feminism is good, as well as not denying that feminism is bad. Furthermore, Feminism 2018 data showed that 95% of female participants voted for con. This was because of the large number of advantages that con presented that were not uncovered in the last round, making it difficult to vote for pro.
19	First off, I did some searching, and the Merriam-Webster dictionary is made in liberal Massachusetts. They clearly bended the definition to serve their needs. I don't agree with that definition. You see, if I called myself a feminist, I would be called a "champion of rights". So, since "masculinism" is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy. I consider myself an "equalist". Feminism today is so twisted and hypocritical today, that it is best to abandon the term "feminism" and focus on equality for men and women.  I believe in equal rights for all, regardless of gender.
20	"The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me? There is nothing between," says Mother Teresa. Abortion, which can be performed during the first 28 weeks, is a controversial topic that some believe should be illegal. Others think it should stay legal. Both sides believe abortion should be legal because of the innocent life involved, and that fetuses can feel pain by this time. Abortion should be illegal because it is not safe and unborn babies are affected.
21	1. Partial Birth Abortions - In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions - In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people - There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries. Though this is a form of abortion, I argue that it should in no way be supported.  4. Dangerous abortions - I am against many forms of abortion for health reasons. The use of coat hangers to stimulate an abortion, for example. Or throwing oneself off a flight of stairs. Or going to a back-alley abortionist that doubles as a tattoo parlor. These are all very dangerous ways of abortion. I look forward to my opponent's rebuttal.  I suggest that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds, such as dangerous abortions which may cause health risks.   I would argue that all abortions should be avoided if possible, as it is a form of ending a pregnancy that has the potential to be unwilling. In addition, the decision of whether or not to keep a child should be made by the woman, not by the state or by outside forces.   Additionally, I argue that abortion should be avoided in cases where the woman miscarries. It is a form of abortion that should not be supported.  I argue that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds, such as partial birth abortions. In my opinion, this type of abortion is taking place too late in the pregnancy for the woman to still have the option to keep the child.  I suggest that abortion should be avoided in cases where the fetus is nearly fully formed, as it is a form of abortion that should not be supported.  I would argue that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds, such as abortions inflicted on unwilling people. In my opinion, this type of abortion is too invasive and goes against the mother's wishes.  I think that most forms of abortion are dangerous and should be avoided.  2.

I believe that most forms of abortion that are done in a dangerous way should be prevented on moral grounds.
22	-ABORTION- Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death.[1] An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.

Yes you are killing it for medical purpose like if a baby with medical complication needs to be terminate it is done for the babies well being not to mention women health and psychological well being also   An abortion may be performed to save the woman's life or to prevent serious irreversible physical or mental health damage. In some cases, abortion is performed for reproductive reasons such as if the woman is carrying a fetus with a serious birth defect or if she is an ill woman who is not expected to survive the pregnancy. In an elective abortion, the woman's decision to terminate the pregnancy is based on her own criteria, such as if she is not ready to have a child or if she has already had a child with a serious health problem. The ethical and legal issues surrounding abortion have been the subject of much debate, with the main questions being whether a woman has the right to choose whether to terminate the pregnancy and whether the state has the right to restrict her ability to do so.   An abortion is usually done during the first trimester (the first three months) of pregnancy. In the second trimester, it may be done either surgically or medicinally. In the third trimester, it is usually done surgically. The method used to terminate the pregnancy depends on the woman's physical and mental health and the stage of the pregnancy. Medical abortions may be done using drugs that cause the pregnancy to be terminated, or a procedure may be done known as suction aspiration, in which the fetus is suctioned out with a medical Aspirator. Surgical procedures that can be used to terminate a pregnancy include dilation and curettement, in which the cervix is dilated and the fetus is scraped off with a curet, and by dilation and evacuation, in which the cervix is dilated and the fetus is removed with a suction machine.   In many countries, a woman has the right to choose whether to terminate the pregnancy and the state has no right to restrict her ability to do so. In countries where abortion is allowed, it is usually restricted to cases where the woman's life is endangered or where the fetus has a serious health problem.

In some countries, the death sentence is applied for certain terrorist-related cases.

25	Abortion is needed to control the population so that the population does not get too high. By the 22nd century, the population is estimated to be 11.2 billion people, and if abortion were illegal, the population would be so much higher. If our country stops the use of abortion, we will end up like China, forcing women to have abortions they do not want, leading to higher rates of suicide. When women are forced to get abortions, many women also commit suicide. Women have a higher rate of suicide in China due to this reason, and in almost every other country, men have a higher rate of suicide if abortion is illegal.
26	There is a difference between abortion and preventing further difficulties in life. In the second case, the action taken is to eliminate the infant. In the first case, abortion is moral or immoral depending on the individual's perception of morality. I argue that abortion, if performed early enough in pregnancy is an ethically sound practice to prevent further difficulties in life.  The main aspect of my argument is that abortion is only moral if it is intended by the carrier. There are certain exceptions when an abortion may be necessary to save the life of the mother or to prevent grave illness or disability in the infant, but I do not believe that it is ever justifiable to create problems or prevent them with out the slightest sense of guilt. If the mother has an abortion, it may be moral or immoral depending on the individual's view. In my personal view, abortion is only moral when it is felt it is necessary for the sake of the mother's physical or mental health.  The decision to abort must ultimately rest with the woman. She should have the freedom to eliminate the infant if she finds this is the best course of action to prevent further difficulties in life. This can refer to cases of terminating pregnancy for health reasons or emotional or financial stability.  The decision to abort is the mother's and no one else's. I do not believe it is ethically sound to terminate the infant for any other reasons.

27	Rather than discussing the positives vs the negatives of abortion, con has simply claimed that "abortion" "enslaves" people into paying for their abortions. If con believes that if a woman has to pay for her own abortion, she would not be enslaved in this sense, then con would agree that abortion is okay if the woman pays for it. Con's entire argument, however, about being "enslaved" would apply to the pro-abortion side, not his side. In other words, con is arguing my side for me. If we became anti-abortion, however, we would have to pay for the baby regardless, so it's a moot point. If we didn't allow abortion, we would have no way to pay for the baby, and it would be forced on us. In the case of abortion, we have a choice.    If we didn't allow abortion, the baby could be a life that the mother is forced to carry, and that would be a difficult situation for her. Again, if abortion is available, she has a choice.  If we became anti-abortion, however, the baby would be forced on us whether we wanted it or not. Abortion provides a way to limit the number of children a woman has to carry.   For example, let's say a woman is forced to have a child she doesn't want. If she can't afford to have the baby, and doesn't have the ability to pay for it, then she could end up in a very difficult situation. Abortion would be the only way to limit the number of children a woman has to carry if we didn't allow abortion.   If we became anti-abortion, however, the baby could be a life that the mother is forced to carry, and that would be a difficult situation for her. Again, if abortion is available, she has a choice. She can choose to limit the number of children she has, financially or emotionally, by having an abortion.
28	Most people that want to make abortion illegal do so out of ignorance and emotion. Research has shown that making abortion illegal does not reduce abortion but does increase the risk of maternal mortality. As to the mother's safety, pregnancy has a major effect on a person's body and emotional state, and every pregnancy carries some risk of serious complication or death. The crucial decision to take on that risk must be made by the pregnant person themselves. Not the law, nor law enforcement, but Women's lives, Health, and basic human rights depend on the availability of abortion, and these are the only factors that can justify it.
29	This isn't your typical abortion debate. Because I've never had the 'opportunity' of being a pregnant lady, nor do I have the privilege of remembering my fetus days, I don't consider myself fit to actually judge as to whether abortion is OK or not. This is a debate as to how the morality of abortion should be judged. In other words, I will be debating that the morality of abortion should be determined by whether or not a fetus is sentient, while con will do something along the lines that the morality of abortion should be determined by deciding whether a fetus is a person or not. Go ahead and let the sentience of the fetus be the determining factor.  As for me, I believe that the morality of abortion should be judged by what the fetus is able to feel - whether it is sentient or not.
30	Thank you Pro for this interesting topic. "I think Trump is the current US president. Agree?" Before starting my own arguments, let's define a few terms. Trump is a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit. [1] Life is the ability to grow, change, etc., that separates plants and animals from things like water or rocks. [2] Now there are 7 qualities that something must have in order to have life. They are: It should maintain some balanced conditions in its inner structure, It should be able to grow, which means its structure changes as time goes by in an advantageous manner, It should be able to react to environmental stimuli on demand (as opposed to adaptation, which occurs over time). It should be able to reproduce itself. Now, as far as I can tell, a "trump" or "trump card" does not meet any of these qualities, making my opponent's statement "Trump is life" false. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_card. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_%28biology%29  Trump does not need to have any of these qualities in order to be considered "life" as Trump cards are special cards which can only be drawn from certain decks, making them unequal to other cards in the deck.  I would argue that Trump is an important card in the game due to its ability to win over a card that is not of this suit. It is a trump card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit.  I believe that it is also important to note that Trump is the current US president, and not just any president, as it is a particularly powerful card in the game.  Trump is able to win over a card that is not of this suit. It is a unique card which, when it is in the deck, has the ability to win over a card that is not of this suit. It is a powerful card because of its ability to win over a card that is not of this suit.  Trump cards are special cards which can only be drawn from certain decks, making them unequal to other cards in the deck. It is a special card because it is only able to be drawn from certain decks, meaning it is not a card that is part of the general deck.  This ability to win over a card that is not of this suit makes Trump a very powerful card in the game.

31	Trump is the most openly racist Presidential candidate since pre-Civil Rights Era. Source 1: (https://www.nytimes.com...) In addition, after a Black Lives Matter protester was punched and kicked at a Trump rally, Trump said "Maybe he should have been roughed up." And he retweeted a graphic with fake statistics about black people supposedly murdering whites, which Source 2: (https://www.amnesty.org.au...) Racism has a significant impact both on the individuals who experience it and the wider community. Research shows that there are significant links between experiences of racism and discrimination and poor physical and mental health, reduced productivity and reduced life expectancy. Further, it is well-recognised that racism presents barriers to social and economic participation which can in turn cause social exclusion and entrench disadvantage, sometimes for generations. (...) It harbours mistrust. It incites hatred. It stops the word 'community' in its tracks. Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and will destroy the US. It destroys communities, causes crime, etc. His comments on Twitter are just the tip of the iceberg, but they demonstrate a deep-seated hatred which is inexcusable.  The statement that "Black Lives Matter" protesters should have been roughed up is especially concerning. It demonstrates a complete lack of empathy and understanding and perpetuates the idea that violence against protesters is acceptable.  Trump's comments on the Muslim Ban are also very worrying. Source 1: (https://www.nytimes.com...) In addition, after a Muslim immigrant was shot dead by a police officer in North Carolina, Trump said "if we had been able to have more police protection in the place, maybe we could have avoided the shootings", implying that a Muslim's life is not as valuable as a non-Muslim's life. His comments suggest a deep-seated prejudice against Muslims which is simply unacceptable.

He"s planning to have Mexico pay for that wall, and mark his words, "" I will immediately terminate President Obama"s illegal executive order on immigration."" Here is the source I will be using: - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26824458, this is a BBC article that talks about how he has successfully built a wall between his golf resort and the surrounding countryside to stop local people from accessing the area and making it into a private paradise. 1. "Why would Trump make the best president of all time? Because he said so. "I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, I tell you that. I"ll bring back our jobs from China, from Japan, from Mexico and from so many places. I"ll bring back our money. " This is an excellent point - he plans to build a wall to keep out ISIS, which could create a security nightmare along the US-Mexico border. Plus, he is planing to build a wall that Mexico will pay for, something that could lead to a major financial dispute if Trump does not get the necessary funding from the Mexican government. Building a wall to control immigration is a controversial issue, but I think a better argument would be to focus on the fact that the wall will be built along the US-Mexico border and that Trump wants Mexico to pay for it. 12.

"He"s planning to build a wall that Mexico will pay for, and yes, he is definitely planning to build it - I can see it being a major issue in the election.

33	First of all, I am not sure why Mr. Trump will be a "great" president. I think he could do a lot of things to reduce our debt, for example by reducing the cost of his infrastructure and business projects in Mexico which he is currently undertaking. Trump's proposed wall along the Mexican border would put us in a lot of debt, and it would be unwise to let him make decisions on the border without consulting the Mexicans to hear their opinions on the matter. He also talks about reducing our debt without considering the costs of his more aggressive immigration policies.  With regards to reducing debt, Trump should focus on reducing the deficit by cutting down on spending, rather than building a wall which would put us in more debt.
34	First of all, I support O'Malley, but that isn't important. It looks like this debate comes down to Trump's stance on immigration. I showed clear harms from racism - shattered communities, (look at Ferguson if you want proof lol) poor mental and physical health, economic downturns, etc. If Trump becomes president and embraces racism, all these impacts will go nationwide. My opponent has no response to this, so insofar as I can prove Trump is racist, you vote neg. And I showed clear evidence of that, but if you want more, here's how illegal immigrants are treated. Source 3: (https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/03immigration.html) These Minutemen inspired by rightwing Republican Pat Buchanan's claim that urgent action is needed to preserve the U.S. as an ethnically white, Christian-European nation. (...) The cold-blooded vigilante attacks on immigrants aren't a new development. Ranchers in Arizona have killed undocumented immigrants for years. They have terrorized them, hunted them down with dogs, and handed them over to the Border Patrol at gunpoint. (...) they have developed deep ties with powerful forces high in the government"and are operating in the era where any paranoid appeal for more security quickly gets official backing and a public hearing. (...) Mile by mile, walls and barbed wire have cut off Mexico from the United States, forcing more and more immigrants to cross over in the dangerous desolate stretches of border in Arizona. It has created an intense conflict zone, as desperate immigrant workers try to cross and survive, and an intensified government crackdown hunts them through the dry hills to trap them, capture them, (...) this reactionary Minuteman movement has emerged to demand even more extreme and violent actions against the immigrants. They have criticized the proposals made by President Bush and Mexico's President Vicente Fox to create a legal program for bringing Mexican immigrants into the U.S. So these Minutemen kill and hunt down not only illegal immigrants, but also innocent Americans. Clearly more anti immigration laws will simply fuel more racism, and the death of innocent people. So since Trump will cause more terrible organizations like this to form, please vote neg - vote down Trump.  49.   However, as a nation we have allowed the conflict in the Middle East to spill over into our border communities, creating tensions between some of the residents and immigrants. (...) As a result of 9/11, immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers are active in these areas, conducting surveillance and enforcement operations that cause great tension and fear. (...) So in spite of having papers, these families, including US citizens, are picked up, detained, and deported without due process. (...) Some cities like New York have a joint federal-local program known as Safe Routes to School, that includes hiring officers to patrol the areas around schools, creating a safer environment for the children to walk to school.  49.   After 9/11, many Arab and Muslim communities began to feel that they were the targets of increased surveillance and scrutiny. (...) This fear and suspicion has led to some families refusing to come out of their homes, or even to send their children to school, for fear of being picked up and detained by ICE officers. (...) The presence of ICE officers at local courthouses also causes great anxiety in these communities.  49.   In general, local law enforcement agencies are not equipped or trained to enforce immigration laws and therefore do not actively participate in these enforcement activities. (...) But some localities, such as Maricopa County, Arizona, have entered into a joint federal-local program known as the 287(g) Program, under which local officers are trained and deputized by ICE to carry out immigration enforcement. 49.   After 9/11, some local police departments also started patrolling around schools with increased surveillance and some arrested and questioned parents and children going to school, creating a safer environment for the children to walk to school. 49.

35	I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago may not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite it changing in the law, is more a reflection of his independence and integrity. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you'd be a Christian, and if he went by the Bible literally, he would have been stoned for adultery.    2020 also saw him campaign for President, this time as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump.  Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video goes into religious territory. 2016 saw him as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump. He believes in karma and that what goes around comes around - that the universe balances out the good and bad things he does. 2020 saw him run for President again, this time as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump. He has changed his view on the death penalty, as well as other issues. The video shows him as a fair, independent and non-partisan person. 3. He's not extremely political. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video goes into political territory. Trump is a businessman at heart, and when it comes to business and finances, he believes in creating jobs, making money, and giving back to the community. He's very wealthy, so if he believes in karma he must have done some good deeds that paid off. 2020 saw him run for President again, this time as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump. He believes in universal healthcare and that everyone should have access to it. 4. He's not only religious, he's also generous and philanthropic. He said that he does not ask for a certain religion or belief, and he wants everyone to be treated equally, regardless of their faith.  He said that he feels that everyone should have access to healthcare and that it should not be determined by their ability to pay. 5. He's a strong believer in free trade and that everyone should have access to a free market economy. He said that he believes in a free economy, and would not want to see the government interfering in it. 2016 saw him run for President again, this time as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump.  He believes in free college tuition, and that everyone should have access to education. 6. He said that he believes in public education, and that it should be funded by the government. 2020 saw him run for President again, this time as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump.  He believes in equality for women and that they should have the same rights as men. He said that he believes that everyone should be treated equally, regardless of gender. 7. He said that he supports laws for same-sex marriage and that everyone should be allowed to marry whomever they want. 2020 saw him run for President again, this time as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump.  He believes that every American should have the right to vote for whichever candidate they want, regardless of their race.  He said that he believes in democracy and that the government should not be picking winners and losers. 8. He said that he believes in a fair voting system where the votes are weighted according to the population in each state.  He said that he believes in a fair system where all the delegates should represent the people in their congressional districts. 2020 saw him run for President again, this time as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump.  He believes in a fair system of representation in the Electoral College, where the winner is the one who receives the most votes nationally.  He also said that he believes the Electoral College should not be the only way of electing a President. 9. He said that he believes in the Electoral College, but that the winner should also get votes from the people in the other states. 2020 saw him run for President again, this time as a Republican, and the primary that year was won by Trump. He said that he believes in a system where all the states should be represented in the Senate and where the Senators are chosen according to the population. 10.

36	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Mostly because Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East and they have become rich. They even built a hotel, making themselves a direct competitor of Trump Hotel. Trump is undeniably a great negotiator, and despite his outspoken public statements in the recent past, he knows how to navigate complex deals and convince a wide variety of industries, businesses, and investors to do what he wants and to work with him to achieve his goals. Trump isn't politically correct. He isn't afraid to say what he thinks, and he can certainly voice an opinion. If he has an issue with you, he will say it to your face. It'd be nice to have a politician in office with that level of transparency.
37	I accept. Before we begin I would like to clear some things up for the voters and provide definitions. There is no clear resolution so I will provide one after the definitions. Trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit President - a card of the suit which wins the round according to the rules of the game (Definition 2). For the President of the World, this would be the President of the World organization. My stance is as follows: A Card Trump Should Not Be The President Of The World, as the title is based on the definition that the card of the suit which wins the round according to the rules of the game.  For the President of the World, the card with the highest rank of the suit should win the round.
38	In round 2, I demolished everyone's source that Trump is a liar: WashPo's list is full of clearly non-lies. Probably nothing on their list is a real lie. My opponent's Round 2 response was just a rehash of his Round 1 rant.  Says who? Does WashPo have a tracker for Obama's lies, Bush's lies, Clinton's lies? -Nope. We can't know how his lying compares without having comparable lists.  Says he. I assert that Trump does not lie in a manner similar to Obama, Bush and Clinton, who had instances where they were caught in lies, such as with the Benghazi talking points. Trump's lies are often based on unprovable assertions, which can be harder to pin down.  These are quotes from witnesses and other sources that Trump was present during certain events that were later shown to not have been true. On the other hand, I've yet to see a single verified example of him flat-out lying. On the other hand, I have seen several instances of him lying by omission. Trump's lying is more a case of him not disclosing information that would be pertinent to the situation, rather than directly stating something untrue.  In round 1, I noted that Trump seemed to lack the nuance that Clinton had in his response to the Central Park Five case. In round 2, Trump restates his argument that if Clinton had had any involvement in the pardons, it would have been wrong - but he does not provide any specifics about what sort of involvement would have been wrong.  Says that Clinton should have recused himself from the Starr investigation. I assert that Trump's action in this situation is more of a smear campaign and he was within his rights to stay involved. He may have been better served in this situation had he recused himself, but I think his involvement was not the wrong thing. He was simply doing his job as Attorney General.  One possible example of wrong involvement would have been if Clinton had given a personal recommendation on a particular pardon application.  If Clinton had written a letter advocating for a specific applicant, that would have been wrong. 101/memo: On the other hand, if Clinton had simply chosen to sign the application himself, instead of delegating it to a subordinate, I believe his involvement would not have been wrong.  In round 2, I noted that the way Clinton handled the case was not wrong, but I believe he should have recused himself. I think that had Clinton chosen to sign the application himself, rather than delegating it to a subordinate, his involvement would not have been wrong.  In round 2, I noted that Trump states that if Clinton had had any involvement in the pardons, it would have been wrong - but he does not provide any specifics about what sort of involvement would have been wrong. Clinton could have been wrong to sign a particular application himself.
39	Donald Trump was an vocal supporter of illegal immigration when it was beneficial to his business interests. He wanted to boost the pool of low-wage labor available to his resorts in Atlantic City. In 1993, he testified before the Congress of the United States and strongly opposed the proposal of a new law that would have provided an extra 20,000 visas to immigrants from countries outside of the western hemisphere. He said that it would have a negative effect on his business as it would reduce the number of available workers. When the law was enacted, Trump pursued a legal action against the federal government, claiming that the new law would prevent him from employing foreign workers. He also criticized the idea of a points system to allocate immigration visas. At that time, Trump wrote that having a finite number of visas would be very damaging to his business. His stance on immigration visas and points system changed in 2015 when he said that he supported the idea of a points system and favored a merit-based approach. He also backed the concept of increased border security and more stringent vetting of applicants. When it comes to immigration from Syria, Trump declared that the U.S. should only allow in those who are fleeing the country and who can contribute to the country's society. He also said that immigration from certain countries should be reduced. He clarified that he was not in favor of blanket bans on any particular nationality but rather that vetting procedures should be tightened to ensure that only those who are of benefit to the United States are admitted. Trump also said that he supported increased immigration from countries such as Australia and Canada due to their languages and cultures being similar to those of the United States.  Trump has expressed a desire to create a registry of immigrants from countries with terrorism ties and said that the U.S. should increase its scrutiny of applicants from those countries. He also said that he supported the concept of introducing stricter vetting procedures for Syrian and Iraqi nationals. In 2015, Trump declared that he supported the idea of increased border security and more stringent vetting of applicants. In addition, he backed the concept of reduced immigration from certain countries to ensure that only those who are of benefit to the United States are admitted. He also said that he favored increased immigration from countries such as Australia and Canada due to their languages and cultures being similar to those of the United States.
40	When you simply dismiss an opponent's arguments as "factoids and other junk," it is to be assumed that you have no rebuttal for them. I don't know what   I respect the will of the British people and hope that the choice they made actually occurs. If I'm not mistaken, however, you titled this debate "Brexit" and I took the Con position. Does this not mean that I am arguing that the effects of Brexit will be mostly negative and you arguing that they will be positive? Seeing as you don't appear to have made any actual arguments as to why a Brexit will be beneficial, I shall refrain from expanding my arguments this round, seeing as I have nothing to respond to.  I believe that the effects of Brexit will be mostly negative. One of the biggest risks of Brexit is that it will weaken the UK's economic and political relationships with the EU, potentially leading to higher tariffs on goods and services, increased costs of production and reduced access to European markets. Additionally, leaving the EU will cause disruption to security and law enforcement cooperation. In addition, the UK will have to enter into trade deals with other countries, which could be time consuming and difficult. Finally, I believe that the UK's sovereignty will be weakened as it will no longer be part of the decision-making process in the EU.   Overall, I believe that Brexit will be negative for the UK due to the economic, political, security and law enforcement, and sovereignty risks I have outlined. >  In regards to economic effects, leaving the EU will cause the UK to lose direct and indirect financial benefits from EU funding, such as structural and cohesion funds. Additionally, access to the single market will be more difficult, which could lead to higher tariffs on goods and services, increased costs of production and reduced access to European markets. The UK's exports will also be vulnerable to changes in regulation and product standards. Moreover, the UK will no longer be able to benefit from the free movement of goods, people, services and capital within the EU.  As for political and security effects, leaving the EU will mean that the UK will no longer be part of the decision-making process in the EU. Additionally, the UK's security and law enforcement cooperation will be weaker as it will no longer be part of the EU's law enforcement agencies.   Finally, the UK's sovereignty will be weakened as it will no longer be part of the decision-making process in the EU. >  In regards to security and law enforcement effects, leaving the EU will mean that the UK's security and law enforcement cooperation will be weaker as it will no longer be part of the EU's law enforcement agencies.

41	Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to do the dirty jobs such as farming and other industries need migrants for it to be successful. 6.3 Billion pounds is a sizeable 0.3% of Britains GDP so for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%. But considering the UK makes 13% of it's GDP from selling commodities to the EU, this is unlikely.  Also, Britain has full control of its immigration policy so leaving would do almost nothing when it comes to immigration policy. Not to mention that 70% of British population growth came from immigration. Limiting immigration drastically could have some damaging effects.

42	Brexit will be good for England. They can close their border to the flood of migrants, Keep a close eye on illegal immigration from the middle east. Also this will save England millions in EU fees. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and they are countries that are well off and don't have to follow the rules imposed by big brother the EU, They can run their own countries as fit. Borders are made for a reason, By not being in the EU you can close your border to floods of migration like the rest of Europe is seeing and not follow the rules imposed by EU but by laws and rules of each individual country. England has a unique setup with all the other countries around the world and England won't be forced into anything by the EU.
43	I appreciate your response, So here is my final argument on the topic of Brexit. Security of the country is more important than trade. Just look at what is happening in the rest of Europe. The migrant crisis is reaching epic proportions all the way to France because the borders were open and the migrants came cross all borders unobstructed. From Italy and Turkey through the rest of open Europe through the poorer nations all heading for England the most prosperous country in the EU. A border crossing with northern and southern Ireland is also critical in keeping the IRA at bay and controlling movement of people. Open borders are a disaster for security reasons. It might be easier to cross borders for regular travelers but lets look at the Sicilian mafia, They are now free to roam all over Europe, The Russian mafia has open borders to travel to England right now and poison people with polonium. The Gypsies can roam all around Europe without obstruction. And finally the migrants from the middle east including ISIS can freely cross from Turkey to anywhere in Europe. Everybody is worried about security and having checks at the borders however it's easier for them to just show up with a small suitcase containing a nuclear weapon. That is also critical in keeping the country safe.  England has been a sovereign nation state for hundreds of years and it would not be good for the EU to tell them that they have to join a border control system.  Ultimately Brexit is an internal decision for the UK and people are split on it but the point is, England will prosper without the EU, just like they have done for hundreds of years.  51.35% of the British people voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, with 48.65% voting to remain in the EU.   In 2019, the UK left the European Union and was scheduled to leave the European Single Market and Customs Union. With Brexit, the UK will no longer be bound by the European Court of Justice's rulings and will no longer be subject to free movement of goods, capital, services, and people. Additionally, the UK will no longer be obligated to make payments to the EU budget.   The UK and the EU agreed to a Withdrawal Agreement in November 2018, which ensures that the UK will remain in a customs union with the EU and will maintain the same rules on goods until December 2020. Additionally, the agreement sets out a framework for the UK to leave the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction, as well as the payment of the “Brexit bill” (the UK's share of the EU budget).   The UK and the EU also agreed to a Political Declaration on the future relationship, which sets out their commitment to work together on security, defense, and foreign policy.   The future relationship between the UK and the EU is still to be negotiated, and this will determine whether the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries and whether the UK will be able to participate in certain EU-led programs.   Since the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the UK and the EU have been negotiating a Free Trade Agreement to replace the existing EU-UK trade relationship. If no Free Trade Agreement is agreed upon, the UK will be subject to the common external tariff of the EU.   Following the UK’s departure from the EU, the UK will also no longer be part of the European Single Market and Customs Union. This means that the UK will be able to set its own tariffs, and will be able to strike trade deals with countries outside the EU.  In 2021, the UK and the EU agreed to a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which includes provisions on trade in goods, customs and excise, and digital trade. The Agreement provides a framework for cooperation in areas such as law enforcement, judicial cooperation, and data protection.   The UK and the EU have also agreed to a Safeguards Agreement, which provides mutual access to each other’s markets for agricultural products.   The UK will remain in the European Aviation Safety Agency and the UK Civil Aviation Authority will remain responsible for the safety of UK airspace. Additionally, UK-registered aircraft will continue to be able to fly within the EU.   The UK and the EU have also agreed to cooperate on security and defense, including through the European Arrest Warrant and the transfer of criminal records.   The UK and the EU have also agreed to cooperate in the area of policing and criminal justice, including on the European Investigation Order, the European Judicial Network, and Europol.  The UK and the EU have also agreed to continue to cooperate on research and innovation, including through participation in the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program.   The UK will remain a member of the European Medicines Agency and the UK Medicines Agency will remain responsible for the approval of medicines in the UK.   The UK will also remain a member of the European Patent Office and the UK will remain subject to the same rules on patents as the rest of the EU.   The UK and the EU have agreed to remain part of the European Space Agency, meaning that the UK will continue to play a role in ESA programs.   The UK and the EU have also agreed to cooperate in the field of climate action and energy, including on carbon capture and storage projects.   The UK will remain part of the Euratom nuclear regime and will continue to be subject to the same rules on nuclear safeguards and transport.   The UK and the EU have also agreed to continue to cooperate in the area of transport, including on the development of the Trans-European Network for transport infrastructure.  The UK and the EU have also agreed to continue to cooperate in the area of fisheries, including on conservation and management of fish stocks.   The UK and the EU have also agreed to cooperate in the area of customs and border control, with the UK continuing to use the EU's SAFE system for the movement of goods.   The UK and the EU have also agreed to continue to cooperate in the area of financial services, including on financial regulation
44	I strongly disagree that Britain must continue to accept migrants and refugees. We do not have to accept anyone under the EU's rules and regulations. Britain should not feel forced to take in people from other countries if it does not want to. I'm with Britain in that we must exit the EU for the sake of the British people, but I don't think Britain must exit the EU. We should be able to leave without any obligation to take in more people.   He then mentioned the example of the Turkey visa and how it forced Turkey to accept migrants and refugees. Britain should exit the EU and not remain in the bloc while still having to take in people.   The other example he gave was Norway, which is not a member of the EU but is part of the Schengen Area and still follows the same rules and regulations. We must leave the EU in order to be free of the flow of people.   Finally, I will address the point he made about the Turkey visa. Britain and other countries were given a choice. They could either accept people or face tariffs. Turkey was the only country that forced them to accept people, and this is why I think Britain must exit the EU.   As for the Turkey visa, although Britain was given a choice, I do not think it should be forced to take in more people. The visa situation was different from what happened with Turkey. We must exit the EU without having to accept any more people.  When it comes to the Turkey visa, I believe that if Britain remains in the EU and is still forced to take in people, it is not a free and independent decision. Britain should be able to leave the EU and not remain in it without being forced to take in people.
45	My opponent is correct that when you use a source, you need to use quotation marks, and reference your source. However, if you do not use quotation marks and simply paraphrase the source, you are still guilty of plagiarism. This is why it is important to use direct quotes and reference your source.  Negative case, the Secretary General of India's Industry is correct that leaving the EU could create uncertainty for Indian businesses. This uncertainty could lead to increased risk for businesses within India.

46	The United Kingdom having to be separated from the European Union has caused a lot of troubles for the people of England, including issues with migration from other countries which leads to rising unemployment. This puts a strain on their quality of life as they are not able to afford for their children's education, health, and daily living. With new industries facing some difficulties in establishing, it would be beneficial for the people of England to find employment, and now they must trade with other countries, which increases employment.
47	Ok, let's agree with the opposition. Let's say that the costs incurred when Britain has to trade with each country separately is higher than the membership fee of being in EU. First of all, economic experts themselves cannot agree whether which scenario is going to incur more cost, especially when you consider that even if Britain does leave the EU it is going to take at least 2 years to gradually leave the EU and to finalise new laws and trade agreements. But when the problem is happening now, we cannot continue to ignore it without trying something new. Britain has been in the EU for too long and a new way of doing things, a change from the old ways deserve at least a 'trial period' to enable us to work things out. My opponent then argues that Britain leaving the EU does not mean we will leave our collective effort with other countries on the war on terrorism. I simply cannot agree with this. The fact that most terrorists have radical Islamic views are because they are from Islamic descent. To mitigate this problem, we need to have more control over our borders. It is our concern that Brussels will force us to terms that will impact our community, particularly with regards to the public's sensitivity about muslims and terrorism. The fact that member states can share info to me is not at all a good reason to remain in the EU. The war on terrorism is a war fought collectively by all countries whether or not we remain in EU. America, Canada, Australia all non-EU countries contribute to our info on potential terrorist threats. And when we still cannot prevent incidents like that in Sydney and Paris, we should not pretend that just by sharing info we can solve terrorism altogether. Notice that I am not at all saying that all Muslims are terrorists. I am saying that we have to take the necessary precautionary steps with the knowledge that most terrorists are muslims. Notice that I am also not in favour of our community to have more muslims from Islamic countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel. We need to be more stringent with visa application from countries with large muslim populations to mitigate the terrorist threats. My opponent has mentioned some excellent points here.

Vote Government. Vote for Independence.   The point I want to make here is that at this period in history with influx of migrants from Muslim countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel, we need to be more stringent with visa application from countries with large muslim populations to mitigate the terrorist threats. To me, it is our concern that Brussels will force us to accept muslims from Islamic countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel. We need to be more stringent with visa application from these countries to mitigate the terrorist threat. My opponent has mentioned some excellent points here.

48	My opponent has argued that the UK will be independent and will make decisions for their future as an independent body. I believe in a more free and independent UK, and I believe in the country, so much so that I have no doubt they will make careful and well thought out decisions for their future as an independent body. The news can say all they want, but based upon the past, independence has always garnered self-governance, and that is something worth attaining in my opinion. It has been a pleasure debating the subject with you, and it is great to see the UK holding its own in an independent role. As to my debate competitor, I will never give up debating the topic of independence, and I firmly believe it will be 100% worth it in the end when the UK can make decisions on its own that stand independent of the EU.

50	Opening Arguments : The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However, it does not work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but if innocent and found guilty of a lesser crime, such as manslaughter, the death penalty can be applied. 2. Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled "Death Penalty and Sentencing Information," wrote: "Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive than death penalty cases where the death penalty is applied. This cost differential can be significant - $5 million to $10 million more. On the other hand, if innocent and found guilty of a lesser crime, such as manslaughter, the death penalty can be applied.
51	Rebuttal 1: It can be more cost-effective, but the one thing about it is that if you have to do it with a firing squad, it will cost more. I don't know about you, but if I had a choice between being executed by a firing squad or being executed with a gun, I would choose the gun. The firing squad can be a little more expensive. The cost of the actual bullets, it adds up. If you have a lot of people to execute, it might be more cost-effective to do it with a gun. But the death penalty allows for the death penalty to be a bit more efficient. Rebuttal 2: It is not necessarily true that the death penalty increases the cost of the trial. My opponent may also state that the death penalty takes longer to carry out, but I do not believe that this is the case. The actual process of carrying out the death penalty is more efficient. My opponent may also argue that it takes longer to carry out the death penalty because more people are involved, but it is not necessarily the case. You can shorten the trials. The death penalty just can be more efficient in that regard. Rebuttal 3: It could be true that there are more crimes in a certain area, but the death penalty does not necessarily increase the cost of the trial. It may be more efficient. My opponent may argue that it takes longer to carry out the death penalty because more people are involved, but that is not necessarily the case. You can shorten the trials with the death penalty.   Rebuttal 4: That is true, but there are certain states where it may be less expensive to carry out the death penalty than the life sentence. It just depends. The death penalty can be more efficient in that regard. Rebuttal 5: One case where it could be a lot more expensive is if you have to do the death penalty with a jury, which takes a lot more time. The death penalty could take longer to carry out. It is not necessarily the case. The death penalty can be more efficient in that regard.   Mitigation: My opponent has argued that the death penalty could increase the cost of the trial because more people are involved. However, I would argue that it could be more efficient, as the death penalty does not necessarily increase the cost of the trial. It could just be more efficient in that regard.
52	The death penalty has a purpose. People who have killed many and even thousands cannot be sentenced to death? Death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that is so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. If there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. Death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. If you think the Death penalty is bad because it kills people, you must not know what the purpose of it is. The death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others.   Capital punishment has been proven to be an effective deterrent of future crimes. Several tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of heinous crimes. Do people who commit heinous crimes, such as the bombers, really have human rights? To say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. Killing over 200 innocent lives cannot be compared to life imprisonment.   The death penalty decreases jail overcrowding and puts fear into other criminals, showing its effectiveness. Without the death penalty, overpopulation of crime can cause strikes and demonstrations which put a lot of pressure on the government, and crime rate goes up.
53	My opponent speaks no form of fact or statistic but morally on his/her opinion. I could sit here and talk about how I think the death penalty is good. But I do think it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money. Another reason why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the chance of the criminal committing more crimes. This would be Kenneth Allen McDuff who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970's. His sentence was commuted to life and he was eventually released on parole but, if he had been executed, he would not have been able to kill again. Finally, the death penalty is a good deterrent. If you look at this link https://www.deathpenaltyinfo.com... You see a chart. The chart is documenting the number of yearly homicide rate per 100,000 population. The chart also documents the years 1950-2002. Lastly, the chart documents the yearly number of executions. The death penalty is actually considered a deterrent.
54	For the most part, these are correct, although there are some grey areas, but do not concern yourself with that. One mistake i made is that in some cases the death penalty is not COMPLETELY painless, but i was wanting to make the point that in most cases, it's less painful than a lot of death sentences. "The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything paid for by the state? In my opinion, the death penalty is a more expensive punishment than life in prison.
55	Ahhh, the death penalty. The government taking someone's life because they took someone else's life. What moral dilemmas it poses! I disagree with the death penalty because it is immoral. First, the death penalty implies that a jury of twelve people is not able to make a decision that could lead to a person's death. Additionally, the death penalty becomes very problematic if someone is wrongly convicted. Death is, if anything, permanent. If someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in prison, it is still a prison sentence, but if someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, an innocent person could be executed. How awful is that?  Second, the death penalty becomes intolerable if someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in prison - life in prison is a much harsher sentence than death. It's much more probable that an innocent person will be sentenced to life than to death.
56	Ok how can you say that it is usual to strap a person down to a table and inject him with poisons that will kill him. how is it usual to strap a person to a chair with sponges up there and pain to their face and nose and mouth with a mask to keep them from vomiting and coughing. yes even with the most pain medication and sedation the pain when you are sent thousands of volts of electricity through your body is awful. yes there is not anything usual about it. when on death row you have a limited amount of appeals that are all paid for by our court system. plus various other expences so yes even an 18 year old sitting in jail for the rest of there life is cheaper than the death penalty. infact it cost. At the trial level, death penalty cases are estimated to generate roughly $470,000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty and costs of $47,000 to $70,000 for court personnel. On direct appeal, the cost of appellate defense averages $100,000 more in death penalty cases, than in non-death penalty murder cases. The cost of producing witnesses for a capital case can be an additional $30,000 to $70,000 compared to a murder case without the death penalty.   In addition, cost data from the National Institute of Justice reports that on direct appeal death penalty cases cost an additional $137,000 in public defense costs. This comes from (https://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/) which actually goes more into detail but it actually cost about 3 times more to put someone to death when innocent people die that is an issue with the death penalty. because if the death penalty was not used then those people would have a chance to prove. the death penalty is too permanent. isnt life enough because studies show that people when kept away from other people go crazy and nuts literally. and there life is over anyway so this is a worse punishment. (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/) also found that of the 3,485 inmates on death row in 1994, 1,278 of them had attained their first appeal and 622 had their convictions overturned, leading to a commutation of their sentences to life in prison.
57	I deem the death penalty to be necessary. Morally, it is senseless that a serial killer would not face death as a punishment for their multiple crimes. Again, I could go into the devastational effects on the families of the victims, which harms many more people than it would the family of a serial killer, but you would argue I would be creating more pain by killing the killer. I cannot understand why a family would continue to support said killer, however it may happen. You have discounted economics and all other sensible retort I may have had, so it would be pointless me highlighting the economic benefits of the death penalty. Regardless of its effectiveness, it still puts the public mind at ease. All too commonly, we read comments in newspapers referencing the death penalty and the revival of it. To put my position bluntly, I will use an example. If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and letting them sizzle in 100 degree heat in the desert of Arizona, I would be opposed to the death penalty. However, this is NOT the case, most especially here in Britain. Some prisons are palatial. If the "Arpaio model" was adopted, I would deem that 110% correct punishment, considering their life would be in more misery than if they were dead. That is certainly punishment in the true sense of the word. For as long as Britain continues to send prisoners to tax-funded 4* hotels, I would deem the death penalty a worthy inclusion to the system.  It is evident the death penalty has emotional benefits to the public. It would create a deterrent, in my opinion, if it was made available in my country.
58	First, I wish to apologize to my opponent for not being able to submit the second round on time. Second, for the lack of my free time I cannot give this argument my full effort, but will still try to convince the viewers of my position. 1) I agree that life imprisonment could easily be interpreted as cruel and unusual, however, with the death penalty, society focuses on vengeance and punishment, but with life imprisonment we can focus on rehabilitation and forgiveness. The death penalty gives the accused no chance of turning their life around, and is often sought out of vengeance of families of the victims, however the death penalty brings little to no closure to the families. 2) As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. My opponent argues that trials shall be done faster and more efficiently, however that will just result in more mistakes, as capital punishment is not an effective deterrent. 3) I accept that life imprisonment is more effective in terms of rehabilitation and forgiveness. 4) I also accept that the death penalty is not as effective in terms of deterrence, as the fear of death does not always lead to better deterrence. 5) Ok, all I have to say is that life imprisonment has a better chance of offering closure to the family than the death penalty, as the death penalty brings little to no closure to the family.

59	Google makes our lives better and more convenient, taking away our freedom. Google is releasing Google Classroom and Cars, which could put all education and information online. If everything becomes Google, they could easily track and control us. A user commented, "If Google buys Walmart, they could have access to our food and purchases, which is really scary. Google wants to manipulate us into thinking the way they want the world to be."
60	"Google gets an average of 188 Million visitors a day. Bing gets a measly 60 million a day. If Bing is better than Google, how come Google gets more visitors?" Just because Google gets more visitors, that doesn't mean it's necessarily better! Google has just been around longer, so Bing is starting to catch up. "As for Bing sounding better than Google, I'm going to have to disagree ;)." Think about it. The word Bing! sounds all happy and jumpy while Gooooooooooogle sounds more professional and serious. "Con said "33% of Google users saying they'd be using Bing more often after taking part in the tests." This actually bolsters my case, because it shows that 67% of people would not ever use Bing instead of Google. It might have something to do with the fact that Bing tests were conducted on the website, where it had people choosing from 3 options but Google tests were conducted via surveys, which gave people more freedom in their choice." To me, this shows that people are more likely to stick with Google than switch to Bing."  The above sentiment was expressed in a different way:  "I prefer Google over Bing because I find its search results more accurate and reliable. When I am trying to find information quickly, I would choose Google instead of Bing any day."

62	My opponent has failed to refute any point that I have made therefore I am lead to believe that he is conceding this debate. He also states: "SO I think that some people just use google for there own inappropriate things." If Google was really the best search engine then why would there be things such as this, I think not.   If Google was really the best search engine then it should not have any such flaws such as plagiarism or phishing. Google Traffic View and Google safety flaws are issues which are related to Google's usage of 3rd party services rather than to the search engine itself.  1. Google plagiarism (or phishing)  2. Google traffic view  3. More and more and more Google safety flaws.
63	Bing isn't being properly judged. Nearly every individual who prefers Google to Bing is a biased party. This is because those who hate Bing often use Google and never use Bing. Google "fan-boys" don't really know what Bing has to offer, and in many cases, have either never, or very rarely, ever used The Bing Engine, and thus, are ineligible to compare the two. I'm sure there's a psychological term for it; there's a cognitive firewall and almost irrational belief that appears to protect Google against competitors' claims. The competition really isn't just a click away. Microsoft continues to run online its Pepsi-Challenge style ads "Bing It On," in which a majority of users prefer Bing in a blind comparison test with Google. Despite the commercials and despite Microsoft reporting that after extensive testing users preferred Bing 2:1, people generally express skepticism below one of the many "Bing It On" videos/commercials run by Microsoft https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1JH4U-c2fE which shows Bing rankings higher than Google in a side-by-side comparison.
64	The problem with the line of argument is that Google does not block results for ‘Authorities on subjects’ if someone wants an article from the New Scientist, all one has to do is type in ‘New Scientist’ alongside the search query. Additionally, Google challenges existing authorities such as The Economist on Economics. This is an issue of Google being an ultimate authority, rather than a single magazine. Startups need funds, investment leads to profit/loss, and those who can stave off risk and make smart choices and thereby profit win and others lose out. Google is simply protecting its assets/turf, just like every other existing company in the world.
65	[[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/micro-markets/google-wins-as-newspapers-battle/866?tag=content;siu-container]] This just leaves us with the matter of defining what “It’s business” is, is any company paying Google for result slots "It's business"? Established authorities in various subject areas have the money and resources to get top slots if they want them or maybe they’re comfortable in already being in a very competitive position and are more concerned with protecting copyright/patents than in being accessible to gullible children who don't trust their parents (I sense an oxymoron here).]]
66	Google Glass can be a game-changer in terms of how we conduct tests. It brings a new level of challenge in terms of cheating as it becomes available. As educators, it is our responsibility to find new methods of learning that incorporate this technology. Testing is not the most effective way of learning, but perhaps public schools could benefit if children were able to use Google Glass in a productive way.  In terms of learning, teaching methods could be adapted in a more effective way if children are able to use Google Glass in a productive way.
67	I would be willing to agree with the statement above that all reviews are "not necessarily" 100% safe, As I believe the listed definition of safe is; protected from or not exposed to danger or risk; not likely to be harmed or lost. In this instance, I feel that even though all reviews are potentially available for the populace to access, There is no way to guarantee 100% safety. We do not want it to be a "low score" and where it is "not likely" that it will not be populated by the city due to potential threats. This is my view that the Google Review System is bad.   I would also like to add that I would be willing to agree with the statement above that reviews are "not necessarily" 100% safe that all reviews are potentially available for the populace to access, The "Cities" have plenty of safety regulations that are governed by law, In my opinion, That it should operate with all available resources within a certain radius for the populace to function. These "Cities" also have a common understanding that potential safety threats could be increased if the city is not designated by the amount of negative reviews. I would state that the Google Review System is bad.   To explain my understanding of what is meant by "guaranteed ranking on your Google business, Maps, And places", I would like to make the following statement: I believe that rankings are determined by the algorithm, Meaning that they are not necessarily determined by the number of positive reviews but through the combination of other factors such as the number of reviews, The recency of the reviews, And the geographical location of the reviews. This is my understanding that the Google Review System is good.   My understanding is that the Google Review System is also good because it is a significant component of any successful marketing campaign.

68	Even though the integration of Google+ with YouTube has been controversial, I believe that Google+ should stay integrated with YouTube. It has increased viewers and subscribers, decreased spamming and comment spamming, and has forced users to create a Google+ account which they do not have to keep. It also has many benefits, such as the ability to add an infinite number of characters and force a user to take a Google+ account. In addition, many users have experienced issues with comments links and accounts being forced. The comment system is also bad, as the only comment spamming that I have witnessed since the integration of Google+ with YouTube is the "Bob's Army" spam that has only been an issue due to certain peoples resistance to change.
69	"Veganism is an ethical lifestyle that extends not only to matters of food, but to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical vegans reject the commodity status of non-human animals and consume only plant-based products. Veganism is more restrictive than dietary veganism." Jump up ^ Francione and Garner 2010, p. 63: "Ethical vegans not only avoid consuming animal products, they also refuse to wear or use animal products, as they reject the commodity status of non-human animals." Jump up ^ "Ethical vegans reject animal consumption and use of animal products not only on dietary level, but also on the clothing and cosmetics fronts. Ethical vegans also oppose the use of animal products in any form, since they reject the commodity status of animals".  I hope to highlight here that veganism is a more ethical lifestyle choice than vegetarianism in that vegans reject the use of animal products in all forms, as they reject the commodity status of animals. The strictest form of veganism is known as 'accompanied veganism' which not only avoids the consumption of animal products, but also refuses to wear or use animal products." Similarly, "Ethical vegans reject the use of animal products in any form, and they reject the commodity status of animals."  Ethical vegans also oppose the use of animal products in any form, as they reject the commodity status of animals.
70	Definitions: Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism In vegan ethics, all sentient beings are seen as equal and so vegans refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings. Vegans do not reduce the human donor to a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is an expression of the mutual respect between partners that vegans seek to foster. In his seminal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Vegans seek to eliminate antagonistic practices with the other sex and work together towards the goal of creating a meaningful connection that is based on mutual trust and respect.   The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that the non-exploitation of animals cannot be separated from the ethical valence of veganism. The vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan sees ethical worth in all sentient beings. In oral sex, the vegan is not reducing the human donor to a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is an expression of the mutual respect between partners that vegans seek to foster.   The vegan will not partake in the reification of animals. In the same way, vegans will not reduce the female orgasm to a commodity. The vegan aims to create an atmosphere of trust, respect and empathy during the sex act and between partners. The vegan partner wants to avoid the transactional aspect of the sexual encounter and will not engage in any activity which reduces the other person to a body part for sale.   Vegans only consume plants because they see ethical worth in all vegetation.   Vegans seek to create an atmosphere of mutual respect during sex which is based on the non-exploitation of all sentient beings.  Vegan sex is an expression of the respect for all living creatures.   The vegan is not interested in the reification of animals, in the same way, vegans are against the reification of animals in the sex trade. In pornography, vegans will not take part in the objectification of animals as they seek to create an atmosphere of empathy and respect during the sex act and between partners. Vegan ethics also precludes the use of animals in the creation of porn videos.   Vegans abstain from animal products for ethical reasons and they are also against the reification of animals in food, such as in sausages.  Vegans are against the production of animal-based food products which involve the exploitation of animals.

71	Veganism should be forced upon 99% of human adults in the entire world. The health benefits, environmental impact and animal happiness make it an ethical requirement.   In addition to health, veganism should be adopted due to environmental impact. Factory farming has a negative environmental impact due to its use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals; animal waste; and sedimentation from runoff. In addition, animal farms take up a large amount of land, requiring far more land to produce the same amount of protein from a plant-based diet.   Another environmental issue caused by animal farming is methane emission. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, many times more potent than carbon dioxide. Animal farms produce large amounts of methane due to the microorganisms in their gut, which can contribute to global warming.  Vegan diets also have less of an environmental footprint due to their use of fewer resources, such as water. Livestock farming often uses massive amounts of water, while plant-based diets require significantly less. In addition, animal farms rely on synthetic fertilizers, which can contribute to pollution and nutrient loss from agricultural runoff.   Finally, veganism should be adopted due to animal happiness. Factory farms are able to produce animals more quickly and cheaply, but the cruel practices can lead to a high rate of unhappiness for the animals. In addition, animals are sentient and capable of feeling emotions such as happiness and unhappiness. Animal farms are often able to produce animals more efficiently than vegan diets, which take less acreage and have a lesser environmental impact.  Vegan diets also have a more humane reputation than animal farming. Vegan diets take less land, making them more humane, as they require less acreage compared to an omnivorous diet.  Overall, vegan diets take less acreage compared to an omnivorous diet and have a better environmental impact. Vegan diets are also more humane because they take less land and require less acreage compared to an omnivorous diet.  In addition, vegan diets have a better environmental reputation than animal farming, as they require less land, making them more humane.  Finally, vegan diets are more humane because they take less acreage, and have a lesser environmental impact, than animal farming. They also take fewer resources and can produce fewer emissions due to their lack of synthetic fertilizers, which can contribute to pollution and nutrient loss from agricultural runoff.   In addition to health benefits, veganism should be adopted due to its environmental impact. Animal farms use synthetic fertilizers, which can contribute to pollution and nutrient loss from agricultural runoff.   In addition to environmental impact, veganism should be adopted due to its animal happiness. Animal farms take up a lot of land and require more resources to produce the same amount of protein from a plant-based diet.   Overall, vegan diets take less acreage compared to an animal farming diet and have a better environmental reputation, as they take less land and require less acreage compared to an animal farming diet. The vegan diet also has a better environmental impact due to its lack of synthetic fertilizers, which can contribute to pollution and nutrient loss from agricultural runoff.  Finally, vegan diets are more humane because they take less land and require less acreage, and have a lesser environmental impact, than animal farming. They also have a better animal happiness reputation due to their lack of synthetic fertilizers, which can contribute to pollution and nutrient loss from agricultural runoff.  Finally, vegan diets should be adopted due to their health benefits, environmental impact, and animal happiness.   In conclusion, veganism should be adopted due to its health benefits, environmental impact, and animal happiness. The vegan diet takes less land, making it more humane, as it takes less acreage compared to an animal farming diet.  In addition to health, veganism should be adopted due to its environmental impact. Animal farms take up a lot of land and require more resources to produce the same amount of protein from a plant-based diet.  In addition to environmental impact and health, veganism should be adopted due to its animal happiness. Animal farms take up a lot of land and require more resources to produce the same amount of protein from a plant-based diet.  Overall, vegan diets take less acreage compared to an animal farming diet and have a better environmental impact due to their lack of synthetic fertilizers, which can contribute to pollution and nutrient loss from agricultural runoff.  Finally, vegan diets should be adopted due to their better animal happiness reputation because animal farms take up a lot of land and require more resources to produce the same amount of protein from a plant-based diet.   Finally, vegan diets should be adopted due to their health, environmental, and animal happiness benefits. The vegan diet takes less land and requires less acreage and fewer resources to produce the same amount of protein from an animal farming diet.  Finally, vegan diets should be adopted due to their better health, environmental, and animal happiness reputations. The vegan diet takes less land and requires less acreage and produces fewer emissions due to its lack of synthetic fertilizers, which can contribute to pollution and nutrient loss
72	Bacon and steak are not really bacon and steak without the meat that goes into them. Also, in many countries, including America, the majority of the population eat meat. While some might argue that facon tastes better than bacon, it can be agreed that it does not taste the same. Plus, getting rid of the meat industry entirely would be different than transitioning from milk to soy (more milk is sold than soy anyways). With no more meat being sold, animals like pigs would no longer be useful, and many of them might be slaughtered. To cause everyone to go vegan might in a way support the cause you are fighting for. Humans are not the only ones who kill living beings, many animals like tigers, lions, and sharks eat living beings to survive. We do not force them to eat plants either.  Vegetables have been a part of our diet since the beginning of the human race, but eggs and dairy are also essential in many parts of the world.  With less meat available, pigs would no longer be useful, and many of them might be slaughtered if the meat industry entirely was transitioned to veganism.
73	Lacto ovo vegetarian = hippopotamus: A lacto ovo vegetarian diet excludes meat, fish, and poultry but includes dairy products and eggs. So you say hippopotamus is lacto ovo vegetarian. Great! We have a place to start. Under your definition hippopotamus eat eggs, milk and cheese, but they are strictly vegan; they are just faking eating eggs and cheese. Hippopotamuses munch on grasses, water plants and such things. Yes, they sometimes bite on a person or alligator who get in their faces from time to Quant to time - they will eat just about anything that moves. So much for cousins taking up the ethical family's eating habits in an effort to save animal lives. Also, the word hippopotamus is from an ancient Greek word (strange alphabet that does not cut and paste) which means water horse. A horse is a vegan also; yeah! Hippopotamus are classified along with other two-toed animals such as camels, cattle, deer and pigs. Camels and cattle are vegans, pigs not so much; non-vegans. But, camels are related to llamas and alpacas; cows have their cousin the bison, deer are related to elks and gazelles; all are vegan. Bonus points for this group. So there you have it, horses, camels, deer, cattle, bison, alpacas, llamas, elks, and hippopotamus are all vegans who care about ethics by not eating other animals. Interesting that whales, porpoises, and pigs are unethical meat eating non-vegan nasty folk, also known as carnivors. http://www.dummies.com... https://en.wikipedia.org...
74	Meat eaters take advantage of life on earth for personal gain and pleasure. I understand what happens on farms, factories, butcher shops, restaurants, etc with meat. More selfishly, I enjoy the flavor and texture of meat, as well as the health benefits of consuming animal proteins. Eating meat gives me pleasure. I understand that what I'm eating may have come from an animal that was treated humanely. I am a more selfish and less caring person because of my eating choices. I may be enjoying the meat from an animal that was not humanely slaughtered, though, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. I understand, however, that animals can still be processed in different ways to my benefit. All in all, I believe it is my right as a consumer to make the choice.
75	Having read the last few paragraphs, you could be forgiven for thinking I'm vegan for animal rights. But no, veganism is not just about animal rights, but about much more than that. It's about my health, yes, but also about the environment, climate change, and so on. Veganism cuts out animal products and by-products, and so it has a minimal impact on our environment, for instance, because animal farming is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. We are also seeing an increasing number of vegan restaurants and vegan-friendly options, so it is easier to find vegan food. It is becoming more and more popular as an option. Additionally, there are all kinds of vegan cosmetics and skin care products. Some people might be vegan for ethical reasons, but for me, it's a lifestyle choice and it comes down to what I personally think is right. My veganism is more about my morality and my conscience than anything else. I feel strongly that if I'm not vegan, at least I'm not eating animals, and I'm more plant-based.  Veganism also has health benefits, too, because when you cut out animal products, you reduce the risk of things like heart disease and cancer. Furthermore, it is easier to stick to a plant-based diet, as it requires fewer processed foods. In my opinion, going vegan is the most health-conscious way to eat.  Now, my veganism is also linked to my mental health. Eating vegan is much more sustainable, for me, because I find it easier to stick to a plant-based diet than one that includes animal products. This is partly because veganism reduces the risk of things like heart disease and cancer, as well as other health benefits. Veganism also has health benefits in that it reduces the risk of things like autoimmune disease, for example, as it requires fewer processed foods. I also find it easier to stay plant-based because veganism requires fewer animal products.  The last factor that influences my vegan lifestyle is my moral conscience. I feel strongly that if I'm not vegan, at least I'm not eating animals, and I'm more plant-based. I want to avoid consuming animals, not just for the health benefits but also for moral reasons.  Additionally, veganism has ethical benefits as it avoids the slaughter of animals, which can be very difficult for me to deal with. It's also about the mental health benefits of eating vegan, as it requires fewer processed foods. As for me, veganism is the healthiest way to eat.   At the end of the day, veganism is more about my morality and my conscience than anything else. I feel it is the most ethical way to eat.  For me, veganism is about my morality and my conscience, as it avoids the slaughter of animals, which can be difficult for me to handle. It's also about the mental health benefits of avoiding animal products.  I want to steer clear of consuming animals, not just for the health benefits but also for moral reasons.
76	Some of the more prim and proper women consider ingesting harry monk [1] to be a common, vulgar practice: unbecoming of a lady and, therefore, they refuse to imbibe such testicular tinctures. However, most women these days aren't so prudish and are quite happy to quaff their boyfriends' penile coloca, which is made of vegan-friendly ingredients. This is ideal for those women who are vegan for ethical reasons and are, therefore, sworn to abstain from consuming animal products. That said, some of these gunk-guzzling girls are also allergic to dairy and are thus looking for vegan alternatives of semen-based dating sites in order to find a partner who is unable to produce sperm or who has severely reduced sperm counts, as some women prefer to consume a vegetarian or vegan sperm supplement.

77	I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, important to maintain a healthy balance of vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets. At my dinner table, vegans are welcome to eat everything but they must specify that they do not want the meat or fish dishes, as I do not want to inadvertently serve them something with animal product. On the other hand, non-vegetarian guests must be aware that vegans do not eat food that has been cooked with animal fat. Given that vegans cannot consume animal products, if they come to dinner I will provide them with a wholesome alternative, such as a plate of roasted vegetables or a salad, but I will not make a separate meal for them. Being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. To vegans, it is an ethical necessity.  I would like to stress that, in an attempt to remain fully compliant with vegan dietary requirements, I always check to make sure that any fish or other animal-based dishes I cook have been prepared with no animal fat. I have learnt to check the ingredients of even pre-made dishes and, if they contain animal fat, I will make sure that the vegan guest is aware. In addition, I am mindful of the fact that vegans cannot consume animal-based dairy products, so I will offer them a dairy-free alternative.       Vegans cannot consume animal products, so if I am serving a dish that contains animal-derived ingredients, such as Worcestershire sauce, I will make sure to provide a vegan-friendly version of it. Similarly, if I make a dish that includes egg-based ingredients, such as mayonnaise, I will use a vegan mayo. To vegans, it is an ethical necessity.   Equally, if I make a soup that includes dairy-based ingredients, such as cream, I will substitute it with a vegan-friendly alternative, such as coconut or rice milk.    I would like to emphasize that, to vegans, it is an ethical necessity that I use only vegan-friendly ingredients, such as vegetarian/vegan butter, cheese, or yogurt. If I am making a cake that includes animal-based ingredients, such as butter, I will use a vegan-friendly butter substitute.   Also, if I make a dessert that includes egg-based ingredients, such as meringue, I will substitute it with a vegan-friendly version of it. To vegans, it is an ethical necessity.    As vegans cannot consume animal-based wines, I will provide them with a vegan-friendly alternative.     Vegans cannot eat honey, so if I am serving a dish that contains honey, I will use a vegan-friendly substitute, such as agave nectar.   Finally, if I make a dish that includes animal-based seasonings, such as tomato sauce that includes Worcestershire sauce, I will make a vegan-friendly version of it. To vegans, it is an ethical necessity.   Vegans are also particular about dairy-based ingredients, such as cheese. If I make a dish that includes dairy-based ingredients, such as cream, I will use a vegan-friendly version of it. To vegans, it is an ethical necessity.   To vegans, it is an ethical necessity that I use only vegan-friendly ingredients, such as vegan butter, cheese, or yogurt.   Equally, if I make a sauce that contains animal-based ingredients, such as an orange-based sauce that includes Worcestershire sauce, I will make a vegan-friendly version of it.   Likewise, if I make a dessert that includes egg-based ingredients, such as meringue, I will use a vegan-friendly version of it. To vegans, it is an ethical necessity.   Vegans also take issue with gelatine-based ingredients, such as jelly. If I make a dessert that includes animal-derived gelatine, I will use a vegan-friendly gelatine substitute.      Vegans cannot consume animal-based beverages, so if I am serving a dish that contains animal-based ingredients, such as Worcestershire sauce, I will use a vegan-friendly version of it. To vegans, it is an ethical necessity.   Equally, if I make a soup that includes egg-based ingredients, such as an egg-based soup that includes chicken or egg stock, I will use a vegan-friendly version of it.   If I make a dish that includes animal-based wine, such as a wine that includes fish stock, I will use a vegan-friendly vegan wine.   To vegans, it is an ethical necessity that I use only vegan-friendly ingredients, such as vegetarian/vegan butter, cheese, or yogurt.    Vegans are also particular about dairy-based ingredients, such as butter. If I make a dish that includes animal-based butter, I will use a vegan-friendly butter substitute.

78	It's funny that such arguments would come from a person who only feeds their dog fruits and vegetables. Of course, it is a well known fact that most animals are vegans. Take the mighty lion for example. It only eats fresh raw fruits and vegetables such as zebra and buffalo. Vegetables have all the vitamins and minerals that you've mentioned. Maybe B12 is lacking, but google "durianride" to find out about vegan B12 supplements. Most human beings, meat-eaters or not, have a B12 deficiency. Vegetables and fruits are also rich in nutrients that you can never find in meat... such as chicken and beef. Cheese is another example of an essential nutrient nowhere to be found in meat and dairy. How can you live a healthy life without cheese? Vegetables and fruits are also rich in nutrients that you can never find in meat - like taurine, for example, which is essential for healthy heart functioning.
79	I'm in favor of nuclear energy. From an economic perspective, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Like my opponent said, nuclear power plants are expensive to build, and we need to use it for generating energy. But the main mistake we make is that we are looking at it too closely. Nuclear power plants are an energy source which can give us far more energy than others. If we compare a nuclear power plant to a thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy will gain us much more energy. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy has a lot of radioactive waste. But I believe that we can agree that we need to use this energy type for the best. For global warming, nuclear energy has many advantages. Secondly, nuclear radiation is dangerous, but the radiation will leave the center only if there is a crack in the center. We have seen this in Chernobyl, but now, we have a better technology and better scientist. We need to rely on this energy type to prevent this global issue. Secondly, radiation is an important factor, but we cannot prove that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course it will affect the human health, but we must still use this energy type safely. Secondly, satellites, radars, and microwave ovens operate on high frequency which can cause the same problems. We must be careful with these technological devices that we use daily, like phones or televisions. We need to rely on this energy type for the best. Finally, radiation is an important factor, but we must not think that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course, it will cause harm to the human health, but we must use this energy type safely. Secondly, satellite stations, radars, and microwave ovens emit high frequency which can cause us health problems. We need to use it carefully. For the environmental effects, nuclear energy has many advantages. Secondly, nuclear radiation is very hazardous, but the radiation will leave the center only if there is a crack in the center. We have seen this in Chernobyl, but now, we have a better technology and better scientist. We need to use this energy type safely. Secondly, radiation is an important factor, but we must ensure that the cancer is not caused by the nuclear radiation.

80	There once was a saying that went something like this. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Clearly, this is not the case for nuclear energy. There are a few operational nuclear plants that are very efficient, and pose minimal risk, yet their startup costs make it prohibitive for much of the world. Alternative sources make up 84% of the energy, with the 3 renewables, wind, hydro, and solar, being the more efficient, affordable, and cleaner alternatives. I have demonstrated that the 3 renewables are indeed effective, affordable, and cleaner than nuclear. We can benefit from this discovery even if expansion of magnetic energy blossoms.
81	1. Those 3500 workers are employed for 20-30 years, which is a good source of jobs until they are halfway through their retirement. My opponent has forgotten that this is a debate about whether or not other forms of energy are good, but instead that nuclear power is good.  2. Nuclear waste is the biggest con in nuclear energy. This will be readily solved in two ways - a. The space elevator is only 2-4 decades away(http://news.yahoo.com...) when a half life is 1 thousand years, which is acceptable.  3. The cost of a nuclear power plant benefits the economy even more, and again, forgets the point of this argument.  3. Fusion reactors are rapidly approaching, which will also get rid of nuclear waste and create more power. 3. He forgets that nuclear energy is a good source of energy.
82	I'm only 11 btw. And my sister is also against me. Well, Think about It, Which is worse use making waste and putting in a hole(nuclear) or pumping lots of bad stuff into the air(coal). Every single energy making way has a bad side to it, And I'm not saying that nuclear power is perfect. I think we should use nuclear energy more til  d we have an Eco-friendly way of making energy. There is a new material called thorium that becomes safe in only 100 years, And we as humans are looking into a way to reuse nuclear power, And by looking into: I mean we are building these generators. To solve the volcano problem we could put a waste facility in the middle of a tectonic plate. Even though there have been 7 explosions in the world, 3 of them have been contained and each explosive reaction has happened in a 30-year break. Scientists say that in 40 more years humans can produce energy in an eco-friendly way, So there will probably be only one more nuclear explosion, And we can hope for an eco-friendly way of disposing the waste. For the 3 argument, You got me there. Even though the cost is on the rise, Tec has to expand and to expand we need more money. I know cost is going on the rise, But we should look into a way to create a more sustainable energy. Nuclear power is more efficient, 300 tonnes of Uranium equals 3500000 tonnes of coal. Also, Did you know that in 2013 NASA did research, And nuclear incident deaths are ranked dead last(including the nuclear explosions) for the most deaths. When we started using nuclear energy we should have a way to produce energy in an eco-friendly way. Tec has to improve and to improve we need more money.

83	Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for four main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency, and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, Which is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short-lived and can pose issues to living organisms that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us as humans. The two available forms of storage are better. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long-term effects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worst nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event, It is best to research it. Unfortunately, We have not yet been able to thoroughly study the effects of this accident. The point is that we must not expand nuclear energy on a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency on the size of the country. Many small countries rely on nuclear energy, Which is not desirable as it should not be expanded upon. The reason is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency on nuclear energy, There will be a growing need, This should not be expanded upon. The cost of nuclear energy has risen from 2002 to 2009 by five to seven billion dollars. This is the cost to begin the construction of a nuclear power plant and does not take into consideration the cost of fuel, Maintenance, and physical running cost, As well as real estate and storage cost. The average cost to create a solar farm can be affordable by an average upper-middle-class American. This fact shows that there are cheaper forms of renewable energy that may not be as efficient, But are more reasonable for consumer and environmental protection.
84	Nuclear energy is a great option for electricity generation, as it is the most efficient in terms of energy output per deaths. If it has the most energy per life lost, it is the safest. My opponent never says anything that could take over the role of nuclear besides more gas and when we already have to import almost half of our oil this is not the right step. I would also like to say that the BP oil spill has caused an extreme amount of damage. (2) America needs energy and the only option is nuclear. http://www.theaustralian.com.au...

(3)  Uranium is the only fuel used in a nuclear power plant, accounting for just 10% of the cost of production. In a gas-fired plant, the gas alone makes up 80% of the cost of electricity. (5)  Furthermore, nuclear energy is far more efficient in terms of capital cost per kilowatt when compared to other forms of electricity generation.  (5)  My opponent mentions that the cost of nuclear power plants is lower when built in large quantities due to economies of scale.

85	If nuclear energy is expensive,  then is it more so than other forms of electricity production? when asked about the cost of nuclear energy, . con said that it is more so than other forms of electricity production. i was interested in whether nuclear was more expensive than other sources because the cost of waste disposal and disasters were factors that would determine if nuclear energy was more profitable.  Atomic waste disposal and the possibility of nuclear disasters are certainly things that come into consideration when deciding if nuclear is too costly. she said.   on the other hand, if a country is doing just fine with waste and disasters, it might still build nuclear if it doesn't give a profit, simply because the energy is reliable.   Again, from a financial point of view, if nuclear energy is reliable, it is more so than other forms of electricity generation. if it does not give a profit, she said.    Nuclear energy is reliable, and that reliability makes it more profitable than other sources of electricity production.  Nuclear energy is reliable and if it is reliable, it is more so than other forms of electricity generation.

86	In this round, my opponent again misunderstood and misinterpreted my arguments either deliberately or accidentally. He claims that solar technology is unproven, despite the fact it has been proven for years. He claims recent developments in solar technology are unknown, despite the fact they have been proven several times. He claims that we need nuclear energy NOW, and that using alternative forms of energy should come later as they take too much time, despite the fact that nuclear reactors take much longer to set up than solar power plants. He also brings up that nuclear waste is stored in the desert, so it can't reach our water supply, despite the fact most nuclear power plants are on the East coast, where no such desert to seclude the radioactive waste exists. In conclusion, with every point of my opponent's argument refuted, the United States should clearly INCREASE the use of solar energy, as it is a renewable and abundant resource. Solar technology is proven, efficient, and can be installed anywhere. Furthermore, its waste is easily disposed of through filtration and the use of water-cooling systems.
87	First: My opponent needs to look back to my round 2 where I proved carbon is released in earlier stages, this is a problem that my opponent has DROPPED. Second: Look back to my Contention 2 I showed Radon, Krypton and other gases released that have lead to thyroids being removed in Belarus see heres where my opponent needs to look to other examples, how can we look to what has happened in the U.S. when we have never significantly increased use of nuclear energy, my opponent needs to be able to disprove these examples, My Opponent must disprove: Same amount of Carbon emissions by 2050 Noble Gases and CO2 released in early stages this disproves all the early facts brought up. Continuing on, How can it be an important piece of the pie with all these problems happening we muster to Belarus, the problem here is the same is that it creates 20% of energy so that would be a 0% Increase it can only create 20% due to increasing demand and meeting a ZERO percent Increase in output. This is a similar problem with nuclear energy creating 20% of the output, which is not the most efficient Solar energy is more efficient and cost efficient.   Second, Nuclear Energy currently creates 20% of the energy so that would be a 0% Increase in output as it cannot create 20% of energy due to increasing demand and meeting a ZERO percent Increase in output is because the set output is set in place and it Third: With nuclear energy the set output of energy created is 20%. This is a problem that will exist with Nuclear Energy where its 20% of energy output is the same 2050  As to Increase in output, it would be a 0% Increve due to increasing demand and output  Third: With nuclear energy the set output of energy created is 20%. This is a problem that will exist with Nuclear Energy where its 20% of energy output is the same all over the world so it is a challenge in accessing the energy output to find an equal quantity of energy that is created.   Third, Nuclear Energy currently creates 20% of the energy so that would be a 0% Increase in output but the amount of energy created is the same.   Finally: Nuclear energy creates 20% of the energy so that would be a 0% Increase in output but the quantity of energy created is the same all over the world.

88	Sorry, I've been cruising around in the Caribbean for the past week. I thought I'd have internet, but I didn't. So this'll just have to become a 2-round debate. You're definitely right that coal and oil aren't going to serve us much longer. We're fast reaching the end of the earth's supply of oil. Soon we're going to have to find a different, renewable source of energy to keep us alive and driving our cars. But I don't think the predominant one will be wind energy. Ever notice that the only places that really utilize wind for electricity are small, rural villages? The reason is simple: wind energy just isn't powerful enough to serve a large metropolis.  I think the best new energy source when oil hits the can will be solar. >Wind energy is the best available energy because it will never run out. Neither will solar, hydro, geothermal, etc. All other energy's will either run out or be too expensive to start up and keep running. >Some other energy's are bad for the environment and will make the world a worse place than it is and will be with using fossil fuels. I'm assuming you're referring chiefly to nuclear, which has seen a few unfortunate disasters over history. But nuclear energy is only dangerous when power plants are poorly maintained or some nutjob throws radioactive isotopes into the ocean. Today's federal regulations make another disaster like Three Mile Island extremely unlikely. >Also, some people are too busy with work and handling kids that they don't have time to try to make a difference in the world and change what energy sources we are using most frequently. I think it will be worth it to switch over to a renewable energy source as soon as it becomes economically feasible. We'll be able to make the switch faster if governmental policies start providing incentives for renewable energy.  Although some people are too busy with work and family to try and make a difference in the world and switch to a renewable energy source, I think it'll be worth it to switch over to a renewable energy source as soon as it becomes economically feasible. We'll be able to make the switch faster if governmental policies start providing incentives for renewable energy.  My guess is that hydrogen fuel cells will be the best renewable energy source when they become available. >We'll be able to make the switch faster if fuel cells become more efficient and cost-effective.   In my opinion, the best new energy source when oil hits the can will be solar.  We'll be able to make the switch sooner if photovoltaic cells become more efficient and cost-effective.  I think nuclear reactions create a HUGE amount of power, and if we ever figure out how to make a sustained fusion reaction, we'll have an unlimited source of very powerful fuel.  Fusion reactions will be the best available energy source when it comes to supplying energy.
89	Who is this man "Trump"? There have been several articles posted on the internet lately that suggest that Donald Trump is not who he is presenting himself to be, as a conservative. In an article posted on RedState, the author states, "The Bible says not to put new Christians in leadership positions. I do not believe the conservative movement should put new conservatives in leadership positions either. Let them be sure what they believe first." Additionally, it has been said that Donald Trump has been a contributor to the Democratic party and organizations that conservatives were against, which could raise questions about who Donald Trump really is. Some have suggested that Donald Trump is a spoiler, taking away votes that could have gone to another Republican candidate running for president who is a more established conservative. Furthermore, it has been stated that he has been contributing to the Democrat win, and that could have hurt the Republicans' chances of winning the White House. Donald Trump covers himself by saying that he was a businessman and as such, he gave money to a lot of different causes and people, and that could be seen as a potential conflict of interest. Additionally, it is stated that he has been contributing to different organizations that he felt were a good fit. Some have noted that he may be appealing to conservatives because he is a businessman who is willing to take risks and try something different. He is gaining support because the conservatives are becoming fed up with the way the "Good old boys",/"Establishment" Republicans, and establishment Democrats have been doing business as usual in Washington. Perhaps the reason Donald Trump is gaining so much support is because the conservatives are looking for someone who is more of an outsider and is willing to make a change.  In addition, it has been noted that Donald Trump is gaining support because the conservatives are becoming tired of the way the "Good old boys",/"Establishment" Republicans, and establishment Democrats have been doing business as usual in Washington. Maybe the reason Donald Trump is winning the support of conservatives is because the conservatives are looking for someone who is more of an outsider and is willing to take a chance on someone new. Some have said that Donald Trump is a friend to conservatives and independents and is willing to promote the things that conservatives believe in. Time will tell whether the gamble paid off, as the conservatives are looking for someone who is a true representative of the people.  The conservative Republicans are becoming frustrated with the way the "Good old boys",/"Establishment" Republicans, and establishment Democrats have been running things, and are now willing to take a chance on Donald Trump to see if he can make a change. According to them, he may be able to win the support of conservatives and independents if he is able to make a difference as an outsider.  As a conservative, if Donald Trump actually believes in what he is saying, he could be a strong candidate for the conservative vote. The conservatives are beginning to wonder if Donald Trump will be able to make a difference in the White House if he is an independent-minded individual. It appears that the conservatives are willing to take a chance on him because they are tired of the way the "Good old boys",/"Establishment" Republicans, and establishment Democrats have been doing business as usual in Washington.

90	Thank you for posting your debate [content]. No need for any changes. Donald Trump is a successful businessman, right? What happens when Donald Trump loses his touch? I've done some research and found that Donald Trump has some unstable qualities. He declared himself god in his last debate. Also, what have Iraq and Syria done to us? WHY do we need to blow them off the face of the Earth? That could start a world war that would end very badly.

91	Donald Trump would be a bad candidate. He has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and does not explain his positions well. He said he will replace Obamacare with "something terrific", but has not provided many details. China is a major trade partner of the United States, and Trump's stance on trading with China could be risky. He also said he would build a great wall and make Mexico pay for it, which could put jobs at risk. Trump lacks political experience and has extreme views on Mexico that could cause tensions if he were to be elected president.
92	Donald trump would be a bad candidate. He has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and doesn't explain things at all! He said he will replace Obamacare with "something terrific", like what? When he says terrific, it may mean horrible! He doesn't explain how it will be! China is one of the United State's major trade partners, and Donald Trump's stance on trading with China? "Listen you motherf*cker, we're going to tax you 25 percent!" China is a very important country to the US, and China would be outraged if Donald Trump actually follows through. Here is another quote from Donald Trump. "I will build a great wall " and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me " and I"ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words." How will he make Mexico pay for that wall? Mexico is our 3rd biggest trade partner, and over 2 million jobs are related to trade with Mexico. Trying to get Mexico to pay for the wall would put 2 million jobs at risk. Donald Trump doesn't really have a plan for that(or anything)! If you take a look at the Republicans' political experience, Donald Trump is one of the few that has none. Cruz, Rubio, and even most of the other long-shot candidates have some sort of political experience. That's why Donald trump would be an inexperienced and bad candidate. And, Donald Trump is both racist and sexist. He thinks all Mexicans are rapists, is a friend of Ku Klux Klan, and called women fat, pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals, and so on. In 2007, he compared women to architecture. He also called all women gold-diggers. He made many more sexist and insulting comments to women, and also many racist comments about Mexicans. There is a Donald Trump sexism tracker. Here is the link: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/10/donald-trump-his-comments-about-women-would-be-racist-sexist/ . He also had a scandal with cheating on his first wife and divorcing her while he was still married. He is also not a great businessman. He had a lot of debt and went bankruptcy 4 times. He also says he would build a great, great wall on our southern border, and he would make Mexico pay for that wall. Mexico is our 3rd biggest trade partner, and over 2 million jobs are related to trade with Mexico. Trying to get Mexico to pay for that wall would put 2 million jobs at risk. Donald Trump doesn't have a plan for that, and it would be a bad decision if he were to become president. He also doesn't have a plan for replacing Obamacare. He just says, "I will replace it with something terrific". However, Obamacare was implemented after years of consideration and debate, and it has been working well. Replacing it without anything to replace it with could be disastrous. Furthermore, it is unknown how he would get something through Congress. Also, he doesn't explain how he would make it better. He has no plan for immigration reform and DACA, either. He would be a bad candidate. He has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and doesn't have a plan for immigration reform. He also doesn't explain how he would handle the issue, other than saying he would build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. He also doesn't have a plan for the rising deficit. His economic plan is just that he would cut taxes and regulations, but he doesn't explain how he would do that.  He is also not clear on how he would stimulate job growth. He has no plan for infrastructure and would be a bad candidate." China is a very important country to the US, and China would be outraged if Donald Trump actually follows through on his threats to impose tariffs. He would be a bad candidate because of his views on trade with China. Also, he doesn't explain how he would handle the issue of North Korea and its nuclear program. He would be a bad candidate because of his views on terrorism and terrorist groups. He also doesn't have a plan for how he would handle the ISIS situation. He also doesn't have a plan for how he would handle Russia and its relationship with Ukraine. He is a bad candidate because of his view on Russia. He doesn't have a plan for how he would handle the Syria situation. He also doesn't have a plan for how he would handle the Palestine/Israel situation and the peace process. He is a bad candidate because he has no plan for how he would handle the issue. He would be a bad candidate because of his views on NATO. He doesn't have a plan for how he would handle the Brexit situation. He is a bad candidate because of his views on Europe and the EU. He doesn't have a plan for how he would handle the UK's exit from the EU. He is a bad candidate because of his views on the Paris climate deal. He doesn't have a plan for how he would handle climate change. He is a bad candidate because of his views on climate change and how he would handle the issue. He doesn't have a plan for how he would handle the oil production in the Arctic. He is a bad candidate because of his views on energy. He also does not have a plan for how he would handle the Ukraine crisis. He is a bad candidate because of his views on Russia and his stated willingness to recognize Crimea as Russian. He has no plan for how he would handle the refugee crisis. He is a bad candidate because of his views on refugees and his stance on immigration. He does not have a plan for how he would handle the issue. He is a bad candidate because of his views on immigration and DACA. He also doesn't have a plan for how he would handle the issue of the Dreamers. He is a bad candidate because of his views on trade. He doesn't have a plan for how he would handle the tariffs he would impose. He also does not have a plan for how he would handle the issue of Puerto Rico's debt.

94	Dear The Conservative Socialist,  Donald Trump is racist because he believes that blacks are lazy and he is a liar because he thinks he is the "least racist person". He also teases Native Americans too. He once saw 1 or 2 Native Americans and said "They don't look like Indians to me. They don't look like Indians to Indians!"  He is also pro-life and believes that abortion should be illegal except in cases of rape and incest.  I don't want to vote for him because I believe in a woman's right to choose and I worry that he would try to overturn Roe v. Wade.  This is an issue that is important to me.   Donald Trump is also in favor of capital punishment, and he could vote to sentence a person to death for a crime he believes is a serious one.  He could also support the death penalty for drug offenses.  Again, I feel this could be a dangerous situation.  I am strongly against the death penalty in all cases.   Voting for him for president is a terrible idea, but I am okay with voting for him for governor because I want to see the local laws he puts in place.  I am very concerned about the state's handling of the Flint water crisis and want to know that better measures are in place to ensure something like this does not happen again.   Thank You,  Drago 31 has concerns about Donald Trump as governor but thinks he would do a good job as a mayor or a local official because he wants to see local laws that he can vote on. He is also worried about the state's handling of the Flint water crisis and wants to make sure that better measures are in place to prevent such a crisis from happening again.   I believe that Donald Trump would be a strong mayor and would be able to put in place good local laws. He could also serve as a great leader for a local office, such as mayor or a local council member.   If I had the opportunity to vote for him for governor, I would feel more comfortable with him as a local official because I want to be able to vote on the local laws he puts in place.   For my personal feelings, I am strongly against the death penalty in all cases.   Again, I am comfortable with voting for him for governor because I trust him to handle the local laws.   He could also serve as a great leader for a local office, such as mayor or a local council member.   Voting for him for governor is a good idea because I want to see the local laws he puts in place.   I am strongly against the death penalty in all cases.   Voting for him for president is a terrible idea, but I am okay with voting for him for governor because I want to be able to vote on the local laws he puts in place.   On a federal level, I am opposed to the death penalty for federal crimes as well. }  I think that Donald Trump would be a strong mayor and be able to put in place good local laws.

However, he's trying to argue his case that I was not specific enough on what exactly you will lose. Any person with common sense would be able to know that I meant he would lose the debate by accepting. But fine. I will accept his argument that I should have more flexibility in what I choose to include in the debate, such as image resolution,  which is why I did not specify the resolution of the map he was looking at.

96	I do agree with your stance on Donald Trump's economic benefits, however, he lacks the sense of humanity that a President of the United States of America must have. He must be able to connect and relate to the people of the US, regardless of age, race, gender or ability. His lack of competence has already caused protests, including the organisation of the Women's March, further highlighting his inability to lead the largest economy in the world. Moreover, the President must act as a figurehead for all citizens, regardless of the job description. He must also promote equality and kindness. Donald Trump's business expertise is admirable, but his lack of fairness and consistency as a leader is a major concern.
97	Donald Trump is a controversial figure who has been accused of racist comments. He lied about Hillary being a sad excuse for a candidate. He lies unintentionally and finds it hard to stop. I know what you're thinking: "I need evidence!" This is a part of an article I found on a website: Donald Trump is not prosecuted for criminal fraud, but the fact-checking organization" Verita" has rated 69 percent of his statements as false or misleading. Clinton's total is 24 percent. During her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton was subject to a few ethics law complaints, including one by an organization called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which said she had made false statements about her State Department email arrangement. But the Justice Department said it found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.  He added that "The problem I have with the statement about Hillary Clinton is that it leaves the impression that she was doing something wrong. It makes it sound like she was trying to hide things. The reality is that she was following the guidance of the State Department" she was not using her personal email for official State Department business."  His statement is accurate. The State Department had said she was not using her personal email for official State Department business. Despite that, the emails were still available for Freedom of Information Act requests. Clinton's camp responded that she was following the guidance of the State Department and was not trying to hide anything.  A Federal Bureau of Investigation probe found that Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state did not constitute criminal wrongdoing.

98	Well i think if Donald Trump does not win the election, The Democrats are not going to have any work to do, They forever finding fault, And not helping the people. I don't like his ways, But must say He is the only President that is actually telling the truth, And yet nobody is paying attention to what he is saying, Guess we like to be lied to. If i was him i would give over the presidency now and let the Democrats sort out the mess they have made. The virus is only to make the rich richer, There is no such thing as global warming, So who is really making money out of this? The Democrats and the rest of the world has put us into poverty, And yet we don't pay attention to someone that is trying to help. I saw Robert de Niro making comments against Donald Trump, And yet the idiot wants to make a movie on the virus, Who is more than just an actor but also a medical expert that can identify the virus early on in the stages.
