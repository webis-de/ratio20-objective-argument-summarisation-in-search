0	Climate change is a complex and multifaceted issue, and the causes and effects of it are still being studied and debated. While carbon dioxide exhalation and car emissions do contribute to climate change, the overall effect is still significant. It is important to consider both natural and man-made sources of carbon dioxide when evaluating the effects of climate change. In addition, the evidence suggests that climate change is occurring and that human activities are the major cause. The sources provided give an interesting overview of the topic, but the conclusions drawn should be carefully considered as the accuracy and reliability of the sources should be considered as well.
1	The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90-100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al. (2013). This consensus strongly supports the view that humans are causing climate change and that the impacts of climate change could be severe. It is thus essential that we take immediate action to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
2	My position on climate change is that it is undeniable and largely caused by human activities. According to numerous scientific studies, 97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is occurring and is caused by human-induced emissions. Additionally, the arguments presented by climate change deniers are usually not based on facts, but on personal beliefs. It is clear that the climate is changing and it is important for all of us to take action to reduce the impact of our activities on the environment. Sources: Shaftel, H. (Ed.). (2012, January 5).

3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers. But they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe.   It is clear that climate change poses a real risk, and this risk is being exacerbated by human activity. There are a limited number of circumstances under which free speech can be restricted. One of them is child pornography. The reason that can be banned with violating the 1st Amendment is the harm caused to children in the production of child porn is of such magnitude that it outweighs the importance of the right to freedom of expression.  The spread of climate change-induced diseases and conflict may indeed be a real possibility in the future, and measures should be taken to minimize this risk. Though it is important to be aware of the potential risks, it is also essential to ensure that balanced and accurate information is made available in order to properly inform people of the risks and ensure that the most appropriate actions are taken.  It is important to ensure that reliable information is available to allow people to make informed decisions.
4	I'll accept this challenge. First, I should ask to be clear: When you say "climate change is a fraud," are you referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change or all climate change? If it is the former, then I believe the evidence suggests that the globe is, in fact, warming at an unprecedented rate and that the majority of scientists are correct in their assessments. However, if you don't believe that climate change is happening at an unprecedented rate, then I am happy to go into the evidence for it.   This debate does require a larger burden of proof as it does involve a complex topic with multiple layers of evidence. It is important to take both sides of the argument into consideration in order to draw a conclusive conclusion.   I am willing to take the time to explain the evidence and to ensure that both sides are presented fairly. It would be beneficial for us to do so in order to fully understand the complexity of the issue. Therefore, I am willing to make the time commitment in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion.  I look forward to engaging in this debate and to learning more about the topic.
5	The climate is changing and the evidence for this can be found in many places. Firstly, local weather patterns are beginning to change due to global climate change, as evidenced by increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation levels. Secondly, the oceans are indeed rising as a result of melting glaciers and thermal expansion of the water. Thirdly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a respected organization that uses reliable scientific evidence to understand and explain the current climate situation. Lastly, the science of human-caused climate change is based on strong and robust scientific findings.  Although individual weather events cannot be attributed directly to climate change, it is possible to predict the effects of climate change on global weather patterns. For example, climate change is expected to cause an increase in intense rainfall events, a decrease in snowfall, and an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Furthermore, sea levels are projected to rise due to thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and polar ice sheets. Therefore, the global climate is indeed expected to change and it is important to understand the potential consequences this could have on weather patterns.
6	Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real. As the global climate has warmed due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, it has led to many different effects on the environment. Evidence for the warming can be seen through global temperature data, Arctic sea ice loss, and declining levels of the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, Human activities are the main cause of climate change and have had a substantial impact on the global climate.  I believe that the evidence presented points to climate change being real and not a hoax.  Thank you for your time.
7	I propose that climate change is a real and ongoing threat to our environment and our planet. The science of human-caused climate change is proven and supported by multiple sources of evidence, including scientific studies, direct measurements and computer models. Many factors contribute to climate change, including increasing global temperatures, melting sea ice, extreme weather events and rising sea levels.   Climate change is caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and prevent it from escaping back into space, leading to an overall warming of the planet. This can have a significant impact on global temperatures, as well as other aspects of climate such as sea level rise and extreme weather.   There is evidence to support the claim that climate change is occurring and it is likely to continue to do so in the future. This supports the idea that action needs to be taken to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce the risks it poses to our environment and planet.
8	The task at hand is to "contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent". From a common definition, anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage, "climate change" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task.  The Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2. Assume, for this paragraph only, that the small trace gas of CO2 (0.04%) is the cause of global warming.  The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would, by a most rational person, be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC, 800 gigatons of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually. Most rational people would consider a source that is more than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people may try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause.   This indicates that manmade sources of CO2 emission contribute roughly 3.62% to the total CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is impossible to say that manmade sources are not a significant contributor to global warming.   Overall, it is clear that manmade sources of CO2 emission are a significant factor in climate change. While natural sources of CO2 emissions are likely a contributing factor, the significant amount of emissions from manmade sources suggests that man has a greater role to play in causing climate change.
9	Round two arguments. First, the scientific consensus is clear that climate change is occurring and is caused by human activities. This is supported by a 97% majority of climate scientists who agree that human-caused climate change is occurring. Additionally, evidence from a range of sources, including social calibration, confirms the level of agreement among scientists.   However, there is an opposing view which claims that climate change is not caused by human activity. This view is supported by 31,000 scientists who signed a petition stating that climate change is not caused by human activities.   Despite this, the scientific consensus still stands that climate change is occurring and is caused by human activities. Thus, it is clear that humans are a major factor in climate change and it is likely to continue to have a significant effect on our environment.
10	Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate I do not pretend to stand for all of feminism seeing as there are many different sects of the movement. I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. This is a view which encourages women to take an active role in society, while also recognizing male contributions and giving both genders an equal platform. In this way, feminism aims to achieve gender equality. This movement seeks to create an environment that is both supportive and empowering for women. While there have been changes in this area, there is still a long way to go. We can look to further engage both men and women in order to ensure that all individuals are valued, respected and heard.
11	Feminism can take various forms, and while it is often associated with advocating for women's rights, it is not limited to that. I am a feminist and I believe in standing up for gender equality regardless of gender. Feminism aims to eliminate gender-based discrimination and empower both women and men, as well as those who identify with other genders. It is important to remember that feminism is not limited to just one gender.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not definitively define words, however, this does not necessarily mean that words with similar roots can have different meanings. While it is true that words may have different connotations based on context, there are often definitions which can be derived from the words’ roots. For example, feminism is derived from the word “femininity”, which shares its roots with masculinity and gives an indication of the meaning of both words. Therefore, it is possible for words with similar roots to have different meanings. Con’s argument is not entirely sound as it does not take this into account.
13	Yes, I understand what feminism is and I agree that it is important to strive for equal rights between men and women. However, I still believe that there is a risk of false rape accusations occurring and that this can be detrimental to both men and women. While I believe that feminism is overall a good movement, I think that there are certain aspects that need to be addressed in order to ensure that justice is served for everyone.
14	My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument, claiming that it is only necessary in some places and can be discounted in others. This view is incorrect as feminism is not solely dependent on the context of the country but instead on a global level. Therefore, my argument stands that feminism is necessary in all countries in order to achieve equal rights between the sexes. Furthermore, I believe my sources provided strong evidence that gender inequality still exists and therefore feminism is still necessary in some places in order to achieve true equality.
15	I agree with you that feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights. While feminism has become largely accepted in more developed countries, such as the US, there is still a need for changes to be made in some countries in order to ensure women’s rights are upheld. These changes should be made gradually, taking into account the individual country’s economic and social conditions. In some cases, this may mean creating a more democratic system of government and law, or introducing feminism to the country. It is important to remember that feminism is not just needed in these countries, but also that change must be done in a way that is suitable for the individual country and its specific circumstances.
16	Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. Firstly, I believe that feminism is the belief that men and women should have an equal opportunity to reach their full potential regardless of their gender. This has certainly changed over time, with modern feminism being more focused on advocating for women’s rights and equality.   Furthermore, I believe that modern feminism is necessary to address issues of gender inequality. Although there may be some areas where men and women are not equal, there is still an overall disparity in opportunities available to women. Studies have shown that there is still a gender pay gap, with women being paid less than men for the same job. Additionally, women are still less likely to be in positions of power and more likely to face gender-based discrimination.   Finally, I believe that it is important to take action to address these inequalities and to promote women’s rights in order to create a more equal society. While it is important to appreciate the differences between men and women, it is equally important to recognize that there is still inequality that needs to be addressed.
17	Hi everyone,  I appreciate the opportunity to expand upon my original argument and explain why I do not identify as a feminist. Firstly, I understand that feminism is not the only movement towards equality, and I believe that everyone should strive for a fairer and more equal society. I think that this can be achieved in a variety of different ways, and I personally feel that egalitarianism provides the best route to achieving this goal.  I agree that men’s and women’s issues can be distinct, and it is important to recognise and address these issues separately. However, I believe that feminism is not the only movement that focuses on women’s rights, and there are other movements that focus on men’s rights such as MRA. As such, I believe that all movements towards equality should be respected and acknowledged, as each can play an important role in achieving equality.  I understand that feminism is not the only way to achieve equality and I recognise that other movements can also be valuable. Thank you for considering my viewpoint and I hope that this has provided more clarity into my opinion.
18	First to address Pro's response, while the evidence was from 2010, the situation remains largely the same today. Feminism aims to achieve political, social, and economic equality between men and women, which is still a goal that needs to be strived for.   In response to Advantage 1, Pro argued that feminism advocates for equal rights between men and women, while Con argued that feminism seeks to achieve this equality through political and social reform. While both sides acknowledge that feminism aims to achieve equality, it is important to consider how this aim is to be achieved.   In regards to Advantage 2, Con argued that feminism allows women to have more control over their bodies and lives. This is an important benefit of feminism, as it allows women to have autonomy over their bodies and lives, something which can be difficult to achieve without equal rights.   Overall, Con argued that feminism is beneficial because it aims to achieve equality through political and social reforms, while Pro argued that feminism seeks to achieve equality in an equitable way. Both sides agreed that feminism seeks to achieve equality, however the manner in which this is to be achieved remains a key distinction.
19	First off, I did some research and found that the Merriam-Webster dictionary is based in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is a predominately feminist area. However, I do agree that the definition of feminism could be ambiguous and open to interpretation.   My personal belief is that feminism is a movement which works towards equality between men and women. This includes advocating for rights and resources that are often denied to women due to gender-based inequalities. However, this equality should also be extended to men, as there are rights that are often denied to men as well. Therefore, I consider myself an "equalist".   Feminism today is certainly not perfect and there is always room for improvement, however I believe that it is still a necessary movement towards true gender equality.
20	“The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion, as it can lead to a mother feeling she has no choice but to terminate her pregnancy. This can often leave the parents feeling helpless and can potentially divide a family. Therefore, it is important to consider both sides of the argument, while keeping in mind the safety of both mother and child,” says Mother Teresa.  Abortion is a difficult decision to make, and can be difficult to access in certain countries. While some argue that abortion should be made illegal as it is dangerous, others argue that it should remain legal as it provides women with more control over their bodies. It is important to consider both perspectives and ensure that any legislation surrounding abortion ensures the safety of both the mother and the child.
21	I would like to address each of my opponent's points in turn. First, I agree that there are some forms of abortion which should be prevented on moral grounds, however I believe that in cases where the mother's health is at risk, or in cases of rape or incest, abortion should be an option. This is because in these cases the mother should have the right to choose whether or not to continue with the pregnancy.  Secondly, I believe that partial birth abortions should only be performed when medically necessary, as the procedure carries a risk to the mother and the fetus.  Thirdly, I believe that while miscarriages can be difficult, they are sometimes unavoidable and it should be up to the mother to decide whether or not to continue with the pregnancy.  Lastly, I believe that the woman should have autonomy over her body and should be able to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Therefore, I believe that all forms of abortion should be supported, as each woman should be able to make the decision that is best for her.
22	-ABORTION- Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death.[1] An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.   I understand that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a difficult one and can be influenced by a variety of factors. I believe that this decision should be made in consultation with a medical professional, taking into consideration the medical and emotional wellbeing of the individual. In either case, I believe it is important to ensure that the individual has as much information and support as possible.   I believe that everyone should have the right to make decisions about their body, health and pregnancy. As a Christian, I believe that God gives us the freedom to make our own decisions and I am firm in my belief that abortion should remain an option.
23	-ABORTION- Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death. [1]   In some cases, abortion may be done to preserve the health of the pregnant woman, which is referred to as a ‘therapeutic abortion’. In other cases, it may be done for social, economic or other reasons, which is referred to as an ‘elective abortion’.   Every woman has the right to make her own decisions regarding her pregnancy, and whether or not to proceed with it. This decision should be made with the help of medical professionals and family, and should take into account the woman’s health and wellbeing.   In some cases, abortion may be necessary, while in other cases it may not be the right choice. Every woman has the right to make the decision that is best for her and her situation.
24	-ABORTION- Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death.[1] An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.   I believe that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor, as both parties are best positioned to understand the risks and benefits of the procedure. In some cases, abortion can be a necessary medical decision and I think it is important to respect an individual’s right to choose.
25	Abortion is needed to control the population in order to prevent an overpopulation crisis. If abortion was illegal, it could lead to higher rates of abortion being performed later in pregnancy, which can be traumatic for the women and can lead to an increase in suicide rates. This could be especially problematic in countries where abortion is not widely available, or where it is highly restricted. This can cause significant distress and mental health issues. Therefore, making abortion more accessible and ensuring that it is safe and legal is essential to ensure women’s wellbeing.
26	I agree that it is important to consider morality when discussing abortion, as it is a sensitive topic that may be debated from a variety of perspectives. While it is important to consider morality, it is also important to consider the medical aspects of the debate. Whether or not abortion should be accepted or not should be based on both the moral and medical aspects of the debate in order to get a comprehensive view of the topic.
27	It is essential for both sides of the debate to consider the financial costs associated with abortion and contraception. While access to abortion and contraception should remain freely available, it is important to ensure that individuals can access the resources necessary to support their choice. As such, individuals should have the opportunity to access the appropriate services regardless of their economic situation.
28	Most people that want to make abortion illegal do so out of concern and emotion. Research has shown that making abortion illegal can lead to an increase in maternal mortality. As to the mother's safety, pregnancy can have a significant impact on a woman's body and emotional state, and thus carries some risk of serious complications or death. This makes the decision of whether or not to have an abortion a highly personal one that should be decided by the woman herself. Not law enforcement or any other outside party.   Women's lives, health, and basic human rights should be taken into account when discussing abortion rights. This highlights the importance of ensuring access to safe and legal abortion as an essential part of a woman's right to reproductive autonomy.
29	This isn’t a typical abortion debate. Because I have never been pregnant and do not have direct experience with this situation, I do not believe that I am best-equipped to determine the morality of abortion. This debate centers around the question of how morality should be judged. I believe that it should be based on whether or not the fetus is capable of experiencing sentience, while my opponent may argue that the morality should be determined by whether the fetus is considered a person or not.  It is an interesting debate, and I am excited to discuss it.
30	Thank you Pro for this interesting topic. "I think trump is life. Agree?" Before starting my own arguments let's define a few terms. trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit "called also trump card. [1] Life - the ability to grow, change, etc., that separates plants and animals from things like water or rocks [2] Now there are 7 qualifications in order for something to have life. They are as follows: It should maintain some balanced conditions in its inner structure Its structure is highly organized. It should be able to break down or build up nutrients to release or store energy based on need. This is called Metabolism It should grow, which means its structure changes as time goes by in an advantageous manner. It should be able to respond to environmental stimuli on demand (as opposed to adaptation, which occurs over time). It should be able to reproduce itself. [3] Now as far as I can tell a "trump" or "trump card" does meet these requirements making my opponents statement "trump is life" true. It has the ability to adapt to its environment, which is a necessary quality for life. Therefore, I believe that trump cards are a key factor in many card games, making them a crucial element for players to understand and account for.
31	Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and has the potential to cause a great deal of harm. While it is important to acknowledge the need to secure our borders and maintain security, it is important to do so in a way that is respectful of all people and does not incite fear or hatred. We must ensure that all communities feel safe and respected and that we create an inclusive environment that allows everyone to feel welcomed and respected. It is essential that we do so in order to maintain a sense of community and trust.
32	Here is the source I will be using: - https://www.nytimes.com/ This article highlights some of the President-elect's plans for addressing immigration and national security.   Trump’s policies are ambitious and aim to address some of the challenges posed by immigration and security. As outlined in the article, he intends to build a wall on the southern border, prioritize the fight against ISIS, and strengthen the Christian religion. These plans could potentially have a positive effect on security, immigration and religion if successfully implemented.   I believe that Trump has the potential to be a great president if successful in his plans. Although it is difficult to predict the outcome of his policies, it is promising that he intends to address some of the issues in a comprehensive way. Therefore, I believe Trump has the potential to be a great president.
33	Firstly, I understand why Trump's views on immigration may be controversial, however it is important to consider both his views and his potential plans for the presidency. It is difficult to know how effective he will be without considering both sides of the story.   With regards to debt reduction, Trump has suggested introducing fiscal policies which could potentially help reduce the debt, although this is a complex issue which would require more discussion in order to understand the potential impacts. It is important to consider both sides of the argument before making a judgement.
34	First of all, I support O'Malley, but that isn't important. It looks like this debate comes down to Trump's stance on immigration. I showed clear harms from racism - shattered communities, (look at Ferguson if you want proof lol) poor mental and physical health, economic downturns, etc. If Trump becomes president and embraces racism, all these impacts will go nationwide.  My opponent has argued that Trump’s policies could potentially lead to more severe racism due to the emergence of vigilante groups. While this is a possibility, it is not a certainty and depends on the policies Trump actually implements. It is important to consider both the potential risks of Trump’s policies as well as the potential benefits. Ultimately, this decision should be made with careful consideration of both sides of the argument.  I would like to emphasize that even if Trump’s policies lead to an increase in racism, this does not necessarily mean that the outcome would be negative. While it is possible that these policies could lead to negative outcomes, it is equally plausible that they could bring about positive results. Therefore, I believe it is important to consider both sides of the argument when making a decision.
35	I believe that it is important to remain open-minded and consider both sides of the argument. While it is understandable to have preferences and be swayed by different factors when making an election decision, it is important to consider the facts and changes to policies over time. While Trump has shifted some of his views to be more in line with the Republican party, it is understandable and can be seen as a sign of him adapting to the current political climate.  It is important to consider both views to understand the full picture.
36	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Mostly because Islamic terrorism is spreading across the region and creating instability which poses a threat to businesses in the area. He has experience negotiating with multiple parties and building relationships, which makes him effective in these types of scenarios. Trump knows how to navigate complex situations and reach successful outcomes, which is beneficial for both the parties involved and for the US as a whole. Trump isn"t afraid to speak his mind, which can be beneficial as it gives a more direct approach to dealing with issues. Having a politician with this level of transparency could be advantageous.
37	I accept. Before we begin, I would like to provide definitions and clarify a few points. According to Merriam-Webster, a “trump” is a card of a suit that is higher in rank than any other card of the same suit. According to the dictionary, a “president” is an elected official who leads an organization.   In terms of a Trump card winning over a card that is not of the same suit, this is dependent on the rules of the game. If there is no specific rule that states which suit takes precedence, then both cards could potentially win in a tie.   In terms of a Trump card being elected as President of the World, this is also dependent on the specific rules and regulations of the election. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive statement as to whether a Trump card would be successful in this scenario.   Overall, it is difficult to make a definite statement as to whether a Trump card would win or not, as it depends on the specific rules of the game.
38	In round 2, I demolished everyone's source that Trump is a liar: WashPo's list is full of clearly non-lies. Probably nothing on their list is a real lie. My opponent's Round 2 response was just a rehash of his Round 1 rant. So, I will respond to some of the side comments.  According to WashPo, Trump's reported lies amounted to roughly twice as many as any other president in history. This gives us a baseline to compare Trump's behavior against other presidents. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions from a single list, it does indicate that Trump has reported more lies than other presidents. This does not necessarily mean that Trump is more honest or less honest than other presidents, but it does indicate that there is a greater frequency of reporting on his lies compared to other presidents.  It is important to consider the credibility of WashPo and other sources in order to understand the full context of the information given.   My opponent argues that since there is not a full tracker for other presidents, we are unable to truly compare Trump's reported lies. While this is true, it is possible to gain insight into the difference between presidents by looking at the information provided. Overall, it seems that Trump has reported more lies than other presidents, at least according to WashPo's list. This is evidence that should be taken into consideration when assessing the differences between presidents.
39	Donald Trump has been known to make false statements from time to time, but Hillary Clinton's statements have been found to be more false overall. According to Politifact, 76% of Trump's statements have been rated as false or mostly false, while 29% of Clinton's statements have been rated as such. While it is true that Trump often misspeaks and has difficulty with the truth, the evidence suggests that Clinton is less truthful than him when it comes to her statements.
40	When you simply dismiss an opponent's arguments as "factoids and other junk," it is important to provide an adequate rebuttal in order to give both sides of the debate equal consideration. It is also important to have an understanding of both sides' perspectives in order to have a full understanding of the debate.   It is important to consider both the benefits and drawbacks of a Brexit in order to understand the full impact of the decision. Ultimately, it will be up to Britain to decide the long-term effects that a Brexit may have, and it is important to remember that this decision could potentially have far-reaching consequences.   Thus, it is important to consider both sides of the debate and be aware of all of the potential implications of a Brexit. This can help to inform the decision-making process and give a better understanding of the potential outcome of a Brexit.
41	Leaving the EU would have both benefits and costs. On the one hand, it could provide the UK with more autonomy and flexibility in forming trade deals and setting its own immigration policy. On the other hand, it could result in economic costs of up to 6% of GDP. This could be mitigated by Free Trade agreements and other financial arrangements, but this is still a risk that must be taken into consideration. This indicates that both sides of the debate have valid points, and that it is important to consider all the facts before making a decision.
42	Brexit will be beneficial for England as it will enable the country to close its border to the influx of migrants while maintaining control over its immigration policy. It will also save England significant sums of money in terms of EU fees and allow it to remain independent in terms of its laws and regulations. Switzerland and Norway are examples of countries that have successfully seceded from the EU while still maintaining their own independence. This will allow England to regain its independence while still maintaining control over its borders.
43	It is clear that there are benefits and drawbacks to both the UK staying in the EU and leaving. While it is true that the UK could experience migrant influxes similar to those in other European countries due to open borders, it could also potentially benefit from increased trade and access to markets. This is a decision that should be made carefully and with a full understanding of the potential consequences. It is encouraging that both Norway and Switzerland have been able to successfully maintain trade relationships with the EU while maintaining their own independence. This highlights that it is possible to remain within the EU while still maintaining some degree of independence.
44	I believe that Britain should remain within the European Union. Britain's economic and political security is best served within the European Union. This is especially true when considering the economic and social benefits that are gained from the free movement of goods, services, capital and people within the EU.   Firstly, from an economic standpoint, remaining within the EU provides the United Kingdom with access to the single market, which boosts trade and investment, and allows businesses to benefit from lower costs and increased sales. This in turn helps to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, the UK gains access to the EU’s financial tools which support businesses and help them to expand and create jobs.  Secondly, the UK benefits from its relationship with the EU in terms of politics and security. By being within the Union, the UK is in a position to influence decisions and shape policies that are important to its interests. Additionally, being part of the EU provides a platform for cooperation between member states in terms of security and defence, allowing for greater collaboration and greater protection.  In conclusion, the UK should remain within the European Union as it provides the UK with greater economic, social and political security.
45	My opponent has made an important point here that Brexit could have economic implications for India. It is important to ensure that sources are properly cited to ensure accuracy and avoid any cases of plagiarism. While it is important to source information, it is also important to ensure the accuracy of the information and to provide context around the source, as well as potentially providing alternative sources to back up the argument. This ensures that the argument is as strong as possible and gives a well-rounded perspective on the topic.
46	The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union has had a significant impact on the people of England, with migration from other European countries leading to an increase in unemployment levels. This has had an effect on people’s quality of life, as they are unable to find employment or afford their children’s education and health. However, new industries may face some challenges when setting up, but this could help the English job market by providing employment opportunities. This could help England to establish new trading relationships with other countries, providing increased employment.
47	I agree that it is important to take necessary precautions in regards to terrorism and that all countries need to work together in order to effectively combat this threat. However, I believe that the United Kingdom should remain in the European Union due to the benefits that it provides in terms of security and intelligence sharing. The United Kingdom would be able to maintain access to key databases and intelligence sources which could otherwise be difficult to access. This would help ensure that the UK is kept up to date on any potential threats.  In addition, being part of the EU would enable the UK to remain involved in the decision making process when it comes to security and intelligence. This could ensure that the UK's interests are taken into account and that the necessary measures are taken to protect the UK.
48	My opponent's debate techniques may be different than what you are used to seeing, but it is important to remember that everyone has their own unique style. While it is understandable that the evidence may have been overwhelming, it is important to remember that evidence should be backed up with reliable sources in order to be most effective. My opponent provided the sources for the evidence they provided and it is important to look into the sources to get the full picture. While it is understandable that it may be difficult to research such topics, it is important to take the time to do so in order to fully understand the topic. It appears that my opponent did their research and provided accurate evidence to support their argument. Although it may be outside of your comfort zone to research in this way, it is a valuable tool in debating which can provide a stronger argument.
49	The death penalty can be an effective form of retribution for some criminals as it removes the perpetrator from society and ensures that they can never commit further crimes. However, there is also the risk of wrongful executions and the cost of the death penalty is significantly higher than imprisonment. It is important to weigh up both sides of the argument before coming to a conclusion.
50	The death penalty is a contentious issue as it raises ethical questions of fairness, efficiency, and justice. In some cases, it can lead to innocent people being wrongfully convicted and executed. However, death penalty cases also require expensive resources and can be more expensive than life imprisonment over the long-term. There is no clear-cut solution, and it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of each system.
51	Rebuttal 1: My opponent suggests that the death penalty could be implemented more cost-efficiently by utilizing guns and ammunition donated by citizens, however this method would likely prove to be both risky and unfeasible as it could easily lead to innocent people being wrongfully executed.  Rebuttal 2: My opponent fails to take into account the variety of states which utilize the death penalty. While some states may be small, other states may have larger populations which could prove to be costlier. Additionally, death penalty states generally have higher costs associated with their trials due to the complexity of the proceedings.  Rebuttal 3: My opponent does not consider the variations between states in terms of crime rates, gun control, and culture when suggesting that death penalty states may be more cost-efficient. While some states may experience lower costs, this can not be assumed to be true in all cases. Rebuttal 4: My opponent acknowledges the possibility of errors in DNA testing and errors in trial proceedings in general. While this is a possibility, it is important to remember that no system is perfect and errors can occur in both death penalty and non-death penalty trials. Rebuttal 5: My opponent acknowledges that the death penalty does help reduce crime in some states, however this does not necessarily mean that it is the sole contributing factor. It is possible that other factors such as improved law enforcement techniques or other changes in the legal system could have contributed to this change as well.
52	The death penalty has a purpose. People who have committed heinous crimes that result in multiple deaths can be subject to the death penalty, which can help reduce the occurrence of future crimes as offenders fear the consequence. This can decrease overcrowding in prisons and provide justice to victims' families. However, this should be considered carefully and only be implemented in some cases. It should not be used in all cases as it may increase crime rates as offenders may not be deterred by the threat of the death penalty. This means that countries should consider the potential benefits and risks before implementing it.
53	My opponent argues that the death penalty provides some advantages in terms of reducing prisoner populations, saving taxpayers' money, preventing criminals from committing future crimes and being a deterrent. While this may be the case, the death penalty also has potential flaws that should be taken into consideration. It can be expensive and require a lengthy appeals process, which can cause delays in executions and may not always result in a correct verdict. The death penalty is not always supported by all countries or states, so its effectiveness in reducing crime is not guaranteed. Thus, while the death penalty may be effective in some instances, it is important to consider both the pros and cons before making a decision as to its use.
54	For the most part, these are correct, although there are some grey areas, but do not concern yourself with that. One mistake i made is that in some cases the death penalty is not COMPLETELY painless, but i was wanting to make the point that in most cases, it's less painful than a lot of deaths. "The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything some families struggle for, for free, and that is fair?   The costs of incarceration vary among states, but generally speaking, the cost of housing a prisoner is much higher than the cost of the death penalty. In some cases, the death penalty is less expensive than life in prison, as it can shorten the amount of time that a criminal spends incarcerated.   Whilst the death penalty can be seen as more humane than life in prison, there can still be cases in which it is not completely painless. It is important to weigh up the costs of both methods when considering which is more economically viable.
55	Ahhh, the death penalty. The government taking someone's life in order to punish a crime is a challenging issue. While I understand the desire for justice in some cases, I believe that the potential for wrongful execution is too great a risk. Life in prison is a terrible punishment, but at least it does not result in the death of an innocent person. Therefore, I do not believe in the death penalty as it may lead to wrongful conviction.
56	Ok how can you say that it is usual to strap a person down to a table and inject them with poisons that will kill them? How is it usual to straps a person to a chair with sponges up there buttocks and masks over there face to keep them from vomiting and coughing all over the place while your send thousands of volts through there body? Execution can be an expensive and gruesome process. However, the costs associated with the death penalty can often be higher than those associated with the alternative sentence. The costs associated with the death penalty are primarily due to the complexity of the trial process and the need to ensure a fair trial. Additionally, the availability of appeals can extend the cost of a death penalty case even further. Ultimately, while the costs can be higher for a death penalty case, it can still be more cost effective than an equivalent non-death penalty murder case.
57	I understand the death penalty can be seen as a harsh punishment and that it may not necessarily act as a deterrent to crime. However, I believe that in some cases it can provide justice to the family of the victims as it provides them with closure and the knowledge that the offender will no longer be able to commit any further crimes. It is also important to consider the potential economic costs of keeping a criminal in prison, which can be higher than the cost of executing them. This highlights the need for systems to take into account both the impact on the families of victims as well as the financial implications of any given punishment. Ultimately, it is important to ensure that justice is served in the most appropriate and fair way.
58	I agree that the death penalty should not be used due to the possibility of innocent people being executed, as well as the costs associated with it. I also believe that life imprisonment is a more humane and effective way of punishing criminals, as it allows rehabilitation and focuses on rehabilitation rather than vengeance.
59	Google provides a range of services and technologies that can make our lives easier, from educational tools such as Google Classroom to automotive technologies such as Google Car. While this can enable more efficient interactions and reduce our time and effort needed to complete tasks, it also brings the risk of privacy and security concerns. If all services become Google-driven, they could have the potential to track and control user data, which could lead to greater centralisation of power. This could limit our freedom to choose how and where we access information. However, it is important to remember that these services are often subject to strict data and privacy regulations which aim to mitigate any potential risks.  A Google has the potential to make our lives easier, however it is important to be mindful of the potential risks that come along with it.
60	"Google gets an average of 188 Million visitors a day while Bing gets around 60 million visitors a day, which is still a considerable number. While this does suggest that Google is more popular, it does not necessarily mean that it is better than Bing.   "Additionally, the 33% of Google users who said they would be using Bing more often after taking part in the tests could indicate that there is room for Bing to gain more market share. While this does not necessarily mean that Bing is better than Google, it does indicate that it could be a viable alternative for some users.  "As such, it is possible that Bing may be more popular in the future and there is no way of knowing if this will be the case."
61	1. Google is not always reliable and can be misleading as any search engine can be, so it is important to evaluate sources carefully [1] and [2]. This means that the argument must be considered on a case by case basis and cannot always be trusted.  2.

62	My opponent has failed to refute any point that I have made, however I believe that Google can be used safely for many tasks, as it offers various layers of security and user control. While some risks exist, they can usually be mitigated if users take the necessary steps. Therefore, I believe that Google can be used safely in many cases, depending on the task at hand.
63	Bing is often overlooked compared to Google as it lacks the same level of recognition. It is important to consider that people may be biased towards Google due to familiarity, as many users only use Google and have not had the chance to explore other options such as Bing. Studies show that users tend to prefer Bing in a blind comparison test with Google, suggesting that the two engines are of equal quality. This suggests that Google may not necessarily be the better option and that there is merit to trying out different search engines.
64	The argument on the right has some valid points but also has some limitations. It is true that Google does not always block results when a specific website is searched for, however this depends on the query and the website. Additionally, it is true that Google may challenge established authorities in certain fields, as it does provide different perspectives on topics.  However, it is important to remember that Google is a business and must protect its assets in order to remain profitable. This can lead to Google blocking some results in order to protect its market share. Therefore, while other companies may exist and challenge each other, Google still plays an important role in this system.
65	[[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/micro-markets/google-wins-as-newspapers-battle/866?tag=content;siu-container]] This just leaves us with the matter of defining what “It’s business” is, is any company paying Google for result slots “It’s business”? Established authorities in various subject areas have the money and resources to get top slots if they want them or maybe they’re comfortable in already being in a desired position and are more concerned with protecting copyright/patents than in being accessible to gullible children who don’t trust their parents (I sense an oxymoron here).   Paying for slots on Google is common practice, and while it may not be ideal for small companies or startups who lack the resources of larger companies, it can still be an effective way of driving traffic and reaching potential customers. It is certainly an option that can be explored in order to reach a wider audience.
66	Google Glass presents an opportunity to revolutionize testing by providing an alternative way for students to demonstrate their knowledge. It is important for educators to be proactive in adapting to these changes and finding ways for students to use this technology to their advantage. While there is potential for this technology to enhance testing, it is still important for educators to find ways for students to use it effectively and safely. Additionally, it is important to consider both the positive and negative aspects of utilizing technology in testing, as well as the effectiveness of testing overall. Ultimately, it may be beneficial for public schools to adapt testing methods to take advantage of Google Glass.
67	1) All reviews are not 100 percent safe. While it is possible to set up systems to minimise the risk of harm, there is no way to guarantee absolute safety. All reviews have the potential to cause harm to some businesses, so it is important to consider the potential risks before implementing any review system.  2) Guaranteed ranking on your Google business, Maps, and places requires investment in the Google Review system, which could be cost prohibitive for some businesses. It is important to weigh up the potential benefits against the costs.  3) It is important to consider both the pros and cons of the review system when deciding if it is right for your business. Overall, I would say that it is important to consider both the potential risks and benefits before implementing any review system. Do you agree?
68	Even though the debate is to stop something, my opponent is clearly taking the pro side of the argument, as they believe that Google+ should remain integrated with YouTube.   The main issues with the integration include the decrease in viewers and subscribers due to the negative feedback, as well as the issues with the comment system. The lack of anonymity, the need for a Google+ account and the required character count have all had a negative effect on the YouTube experience.   The evidence for this can be seen in the comments sections of many videos, where users report feeling more inclined to comment when the accounts were linked and that the overall experience was negatively impacted.   The negative effects of the integration can be seen both in terms of the user experience, as well as in terms of the numbers, as viewers and subscribers have dropped off.  This is likely due to the integration, as users may be more hesitant to use the platform with the negative feedback that has been reported.   It is clear that the integration has had an adverse effect on the platform, leading to a decrease in both viewers and subscribers, and the negative comments reported from users.
69	To go vegan and stop the murder of these animals would not only counter the effects of our evolution, as certain animals have adapted to survive in predator-rich environments, but would also destroy the industries involved in the selling of these foods, which might mess up the economy. Plus, steak and bacon are amazing, so I believe that our current practices are reasonable and that veganism would be an overreaching solution.

Also see Francis, Richard. Fruitlands: The Alcott Family and their Search for Utopia, Yale University Press, 2010. Jump up ^ “Vegan Diets Become More Popular, More Mainstream”, Associated Press/CBS News, 5 January 2011: “Ethical vegans have a moral aversion to harming animals for human consumption, not just for dietary or health reasons, but because they believe that it is wrong to use animals for any purpose, regardless of whether or not the animal is killed for the end product. Though the term often is used to describe people who follow the diet, not the larger philosophy.” Francione, Gary and Garner, Robert. The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation? Columbia University Press, 2010 (hereafter Francione and Garner 2010), p. 62: “Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical vegans believe that all animal use is unethical, regardless of whether or not the animal is killed for the end product, and they strive to reduce their reliance on animal products as much as possible.” “Veganism”, Vegetarian Times, January 1989: “Webster's dictionary provides a most dry and limiting definition of the word 'vegan': 'one that consumes no animal food or dairy products.' This description explains dietary veganism, but so-called ethical vegans, who form a minority, carry the philosophy further.”
70	Definitions: Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals http://en.wikipedia.org... In modern society, the production of consumer goods is often driven by profits and market demands. This can lead to exploitation of animals, both in terms of the resources used to produce the goods, as well as the animals themselves who are used as a source of food or resources. As vegans, we recognise this and seek to reduce the exploitation of animals, while still being able to meet our needs. We believe that vegetarian and vegan diets offer a more ethical approach as they do not require the use of animal products.   In addition to dietary choices, vegans also try to reduce their consumption of animal products in other areas, such as clothing and homeware. While it is impossible to eliminate all animal products from our lives, vegans strive to reduce their consumption and support businesses and brands that reduce animal exploitation.   The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain’t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.   It is clear that veganism is not only ethically sound, but also allows for mutual respect and harmony between all sentient beings. As vegans, we must strive to be conscious of the products we use and the effect they have on animals, people and the environment. Veganism is an ethical and sustainable lifestyle choice which allows us to live in harmony with the world.
71	Contrary to the argument, veganism should not be imposed upon everyone as a matter of law as it is an individual's right to choose what they eat. While veganism may be beneficial to the environment and animal welfare, it is not feasible or practical to make it mandatory for everyone, as this would infringe upon individual freedom.
72	Bacon and steak are not as satisfying without the meat that goes into them, and there is no doubt that vegan options are gaining more popularity. While transitioning from dairy to vegan may be easier in some countries, it may not be possible in all and there may be different changes that need to be made to suit local diets. While it may be difficult to completely eliminate meat consumption, it is important to remember that meat is not essential for human health and that there are alternatives available. By making these changes, we can still provide animals with the same care, while making a positive impact on the environment.
73	Lacto ovo vegetarianism is a vegan diet which excludes all animal-based products such as meat, fish and poultry. However, it does allow for the consumption of dairy products and eggs. Therefore, hippopotamuses which only consume dairy products and eggs are still considered to be vegetarian as they are following a vegan diet. This means that the closest living relatives of hippopotamuses, whales and porpoises, who are not vegetarian, are in fact non-vegetarian as they do consume animal-based products. It is important to remember that the vegan diet is defined by what is consumed and not by the individual’s presentation of the diet.
74	Meat eaters have a variety of reasons for eating meat and animal products, ranging from taste preference to health benefits. While some people may have a greater understanding of the production process and its impacts on the environment, it does not necessarily mean that everyone is aware of the implications of their choices. Eating meat is a personal decision and should not be judged solely on the basis of personal knowledge. Everyone should be aware of the implications of their choices and make informed decisions based on their own beliefs and values.
75	Thank you for your response. I understand your argument that it may be difficult to suddenly stop consuming meat, especially given the long-term impacts that it may have on the global economy. However, veganism is not intended to be a one-time shift in diet, but rather a long-term lifestyle change. As vegans are conscious of the source of their food and seek to minimize animal suffering, they may be more likely to source their food in a more sustainable manner, allowing for a gradual transition away from animal agriculture. This could ultimately have a more significant impact in the long run than if meat consumption were to continue.   I believe that veganism is an effective way to reduce animal suffering while still providing the same enjoyment to those who eat meat. It may be difficult to implement in the short-term, but it is possible to achieve in the long-term.
76	Some of the more prim and proper women might be hesitant to ingest their partners’ semen due to potential health risks. However, most women these days are not as concerned and are comfortable drinking their partners’ semen as a part of their sexual experience. Vegan women may have an even more difficult time as they need to abstain from animal products for ethical reasons. This can pose a challenge as humans are a species of animal and sperm is produced by humans, making it more difficult for vegan women to take part in this activity.
77	I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's "semenal work". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is "seminal", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious.   Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then "finish the job" by swallowing his muck will "remove antagonism" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. So, by choosing to swallow her sire's semen vegan women are deliberately breaking their vow not to consume animal products and are, therefore, hypocrites.   [1] I expect. [2] Probably.    In conclusion, it is clear that a vegan woman cannot expect to receive the same nutrition from a vegetarian diet due to the variation in the amount of protein available in different food sources. Therefore, in order to receive the same nutrition as her boyfriend, she may need to consume animal products on occasion, therefore making it difficult for her to adhere to a vegetarian diet.  Overall, it is clear that veganism requires an understanding of different nutritional needs, as well as flexibility in diet in order to meet these needs.
78	It's understandable that some people may require supplementation to meet their nutritional needs, however it is important to ensure that all diets are balanced to ensure the best health outcomes. Although vegetables and fruits contain many essential vitamins and minerals, some omnivores may still require meat, dairy and eggs to meet their dietary needs. Each diet is unique and it is important to consult with a dietician or nutritionist to ensure that the diet is balanced for the individual.
79	I'm in favour of using nuclear energy as it has many economic benefits. Building nuclear power plants is expensive, but they can generate more energy than other sources and are therefore cost-effective in the long-term. Comparing a nuclear power plant to a thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy can gain us more energy while requiring less input. Additionally, we need to be mindful of the effects of global warming, and nuclear energy can be a useful tool in our arsenal to help fight it. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy does produce radioactive wastes, however the majority of the energy produced is without any carbon dioxide waste. This means that it can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change.   In terms of risks, nuclear radiation is indeed risky, but Chernobyl has shown us that it is possible to have a safe nuclear power plant if regulated properly. We now have better technology and better scientists to help us make use of nuclear energy safely. Radiation does pose a risk, but it is important to understand that it is unlikely to cause cancer. Other technological devices such as phones or televisions do create radiation, but we do not necessarily need to avoid them as they are within safe levels.   Overall, it is clear that nuclear energy is an efficient and viable solution for our energy needs while taking into account the risks of climate change. It is a powerful tool that can help us reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, and it should not be discounted.
80	I agree that nuclear energy does pose certain risks and that there is no perfect solution for disposing of toxic waste. However, in terms of cost, renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro and solar still have a long way to go before competing with nuclear energy. In terms of affordability, nuclear energy remains an attractive option due to its relatively low cost compared to other sources. Additionally, it is important to consider the long-term implications of alternative energy sources. Although they may be cheaper upfront, in the long run they can be more expensive than nuclear energy. This makes nuclear energy a more attractive option for countries that are looking for a reliable and cost-effective form of energy.  Thus, while alternative energy sources do offer some advantages, nuclear energy still remains an attractive option.
81	1. Those 3500 workers are employed for 20-30 years, which contributes to the economy as these workers spend their wages on goods and services. This boosts the economy in the short-term and helps create long-term economic growth.  2. Nuclear waste is a challenge but it can be managed in two ways. Firstly, the development of a space elevator, which could facilitate the transport of nuclear waste into space, is within the next few decades. Secondly, the development of fusion reactors which could eliminate nuclear waste entirely. Both of these technologies offer considerable potential and could make a significant difference in the long-term.  3. The cost of nuclear power can offer considerable benefits to an economy in the long-term as it creates jobs, helps manage waste and can drive economic growth. This should not be forgotten when assessing the potential of different energy sources.
82	I understand your concern about the potential harm that nuclear energy can cause. However, I would argue that it is still a viable option for creating energy as it has many benefits when compared to other methods.   Nuclear energy is more efficient in terms of the amount of energy it can generate per unit of Uranium. Uranium is much more efficient than coal, meaning less Uranium is needed to create the same amount of energy. Additionally, nuclear energy has a much lower environmental impact than other methods, as evidenced by the research done by NASA in 2013.   The waste created by nuclear power is also much more manageable than other forms of energy production. It takes much longer for nuclear waste to become hazardous, and it can be safely stored for many hundreds of years.  Overall, while there are risks associated with nuclear energy, these can be mitigated by good safety protocols and improved technology. We must also consider the environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness of nuclear energy in comparison to other forms of energy production.
83	Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not rely too heavily on nuclear energy for several reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not as efficient because it is short lived and can pose risks to living organisms as they break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us as plants and animals receive them. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea as it pushes the waste away from us, however there is still some uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of this storage and the creation of new land masses due to volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world, with many long-term effects still unknown. In addition, until we are better educated on the subject, nuclear energy should be used with caution and with greater regulation. Renewable energy sources are becoming more cost effective as they continue to develop, such as solar farms which can be built by average upper-middle-class Americans. This shows that renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly feasible. Nuclear energy can be an important part of our energy mix, but we need to approach it with caution and understanding of the risks and potential impacts.
84	1. My opponent cites studies which show that there have been no deaths or illnesses from nuclear accidents. This is correct and provides evidence to show that nuclear energy is relatively safe when compared to other forms of energy production. 2. However, my opponent also claims that the cost of nuclear energy is more expensive than other forms of energy production. This is not necessarily the case. My opponent cites the cost of nuclear energy per kwh as being higher than other forms of energy production. This is only true if the cost of production for each type of energy is looked at individually. If one considers the cost of production over time, it is likely that nuclear energy will be more cost effective due to its lower cost of operation and reduced maintenance.  3. My opponent also claims that nuclear energy produces less energy compared to other forms of energy production. This is again, only true when considering the individual costs of each type of energy. When considering the costs over time, it is likely that nuclear energy will be more cost effective. 4. My opponent also claims that nuclear waste disposal is a major issue when it comes to nuclear energy production. However, this is actually not the case. Nuclear waste can be safely disposed of with modern technology, and it is actually much safer to dispose of nuclear waste than to leave it in a facility. 5. Finally, my opponent claims that America needs energy and nuclear energy is the way to go. This is again, only true when considering the individual costs of each type of energy. When considering the costs over time, it is likely that nuclear energy will be more cost effective.
85	As already acknowledged, there are cons to nuclear, as there are cons to all sources. Although there is always the risk of an accident, nuclear energy does have some advantages over other sources of energy. These include being able to generate more power for less money, as well as the fact that it does not lead to the destruction of the atmosphere.   In contrast to the risk of nuclear power, other countries seem to be managing well. This indicates that the risk of nuclear energy is manageable and can be mitigated. This is particularly beneficial as it can provide more power for less money while still keeping the environment safe.   To conclude, although nuclear energy does present some risks, it can still be a viable and cost-effective form of energy when compared to other sources.
86	In this round, my opponent presented an argument which misrepresented my position on nuclear energy. I had argued that nuclear energy should be gradually increased, as alternatives such as solar energy should be used earlier in order to reduce time to deployment. My opponent argued that nuclear energy can be increased much faster than solar energy and stated that most nuclear reactors can be set up much quicker than solar power plants. This is inaccurate; most nuclear reactors require significantly less time to construct, but many solar plants can be deployed in a much shorter time frame. This demonstrates the importance of investing in both types of energy in order to meet energy demands in a timely manner.     To conclude, I believe it is important to increase nuclear energy production while also investing in solar energy to ensure a reliable and quick energy source.
87	First, I would like to apologize for forgetting to include citations in my Round 2 argument. It is true that nuclear energy has certain drawbacks, including carbon emissions, noble gas emissions, and the potential for accidents. However, nuclear energy can still be an important piece of the energy pie, as it produces less carbon emissions than other sources of energy when used in moderation. Thus, it is important to consider both the risks and benefits of nuclear energy when making policy decisions.   In regards to nuclear energy’s potential to meet increasing demands, it is important to note that increased demand would likely lead to an increase in the proportion of nuclear energy in the energy mix. This means that although it may begin as a 20% contribution to energy demand, it could rise to 40% or even 60%.  In short, nuclear energy’s contribution to energy demand can increase as needed, making it an important piece of the energy pie.   Overall, it is important to understand the pros and cons of nuclear energy in order to make informed decisions. While it does have some risks, it can also be an effective and efficient form of energy in the right context.
88	Nuclear energy has the potential to be an excellent source of energy due to its high power output and low emissions. While it is true that nuclear energy is more expensive to install initially, the costs associated with it are typically lower in the long run. Furthermore, nuclear energy has the potential to be safer and more efficient if adequate safety measures and maintenance are in place. While other renewable energy sources are reliable and cost effective, it is important to consider all aspects of a given energy source before making a decision as to which is the best option. Ultimately, the most efficient and cost effective source of energy will depend on the particular situation and the needs of the user.
89	Who is this man "Trump"? Several articles have been circulating online that indicate that Donald Trump may not be as conservative as he presents himself to be. In an article from RedState, the author suggests that Donald Trump has been a contributor to the Democratic party and organizations that conservatives were opposed to. This could potentially take away votes from conservative candidates, as Trump has gained popularity among Republican voters. The article also claims that Donald Trump has been influenced by liberal sources in his stance on certain issues. This is a concern as Trump gains support and could potentially impact the Republican's chances of winning the White House.   The issue is further complicated by the fact that Trump is a businessman and may have taken different approaches when campaigning due to the need for appeal. This could be seen as both a benefit and a risk. It is important to consider the fact that Trump may not necessarily always act out of alignment with conservative values simply for the sake of winning. This could lead to a successful presidency, but it is also worth considering.   In the end, only time will be able to provide a conclusive answer as to whether or not Trump is truly sincere in his views and actions. It is necessary to be aware of the potential risks in order to make an informed decision when voting.
90	Thank you for posting your debate. It is important to consider the presidency of Donald Trump in its entirety, not just his successes. While he may have had some successes, it is also important to understand his potential pitfalls as president. It is essential to consider both sides of the debate when voting, as this could significantly impact the future of the US. It is important to weigh both the pros and cons of a presidential candidate before casting a vote.
91	Donald Trump would be a bad candidate as he has no political experience, as well as being both racist and sexist. He has made derogatory comments about Mexicans, as well as calling women "fat, pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals" and more. This could be extremely detrimental if he were to become President, as he would lack the political experience that other candidates have. This could put 2 million jobs at risk as he has not provided any detailed plans about how he would go about tackling such issues. His stance on trade with China is also concerning, as he has said he would implement tariffs with no detail on how this would benefit the US. It is clear that he is an inexperienced candidate and could be potentially damaging for the US if elected.
92	Donald Trump’s lack of political experience could be a drawback, but it can also be beneficial as he may not be tied to existing political interests. He may have a different approach to policy making than traditional candidates, and this could prove successful. Furthermore, he has stated that he would like to work with other countries to find solutions that benefit both the US and its trading partners. Additionally, while he may use strong language to make his points, there is no evidence to suggest that he intends to act in ways that could harm the US or its relations with other countries. Thus, while his lack of political experience may pose risks, it could also lead to successful policies if used in the right way.  It is difficult to make an overall assessment of his suitability for the presidency without considering the full range of potential outcomes.  He may prove to be an effective president if given the opportunity.
93	I will start off with some definitions. Definitions Sith- ancient kratocratic organization wielding the dark side of the Force, typically using crimson lightsabers and attempting to achieve great power. Kratocratic- government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning.   Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power- One of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruct. Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government.   Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power.   Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist.   Donald Trump wears Sith garments and command a legion of soldiers- Donald Trump has been observed wearing traditional Sith cloaks, and has been seen commanding armies of Stormtroopers. This guarantees his connection with the Dark Side.   Sources  https://i.imgflip.com/21vy.jpg https://i.imgflip.com/21vy.jpg
94	Dear The Conservative Socialist,  Donald Trump is not racist and does not believe that blacks are lazy. He is not a liar for thinking that he is the "least racist person" as racism is subjective and depends on one’s own experience and perspective. He may have seen a few Native Americans while he was traveling, but this does not indicate that he believes all Native Americans look the same.   Trump’s views on immigration and race may be controversial, but it is important to consider the context surrounding these comments in order to understand his beliefs.   Regarding voting for Trump, it is important to consider the potential benefits and risks of each decision. While Trump's views on race may be controversial, this does not necessarily mean that he is not the best candidate for the job.   Ultimately, it is important for individuals to examine the policies and views of each candidate in order to decide who to support.   Thank you for considering this viewpoint.   Sincerely,  Drago 31
95	qwzx has accepted this debate with knowledge that this results in automatic loss, as dictated by rule 6. However, he's trying to argue his case that I was not specific enough on what exactly you will lose. Any person with common sense would be able to know that I meant he would lose the debate by accepting. However, it is possible that I may have intended to refer to Donald Trump specifically, as there are distinct similarities between the two. This could have been more clearly stated by including his middle name. In this case, it could be argued that I still would have lost the debate even if I had specified the middle name due to the similarities between the two. However, it is also possible that I may have been referring to a different president altogether, so it is difficult to definitively say that I would have lost the debate if I had been more specific. Therefore, I believe the argument can go either way and it is impossible to definitively say which side would have won.
96	Although I do agree with your stance on Donald Trump's economic benefits, he has no sense of humanity. A POTUS must have the ability to connect and relate to the people of The United States of America, regardless of age, race, gender, or ability. The fact that Trump has already caused protests, including the organization of the Women's March, further proves that Trump is not the right leader for the country. Furthermore, the president should act as a role model for all citizens, regardless of whether it is part of the job description. It is essential that the President promotes equality and kindness, as this is an important element of the presidency that must not be overlooked.    Whilst Trump's business background may prove beneficial to the economy, it is important to consider the wider needs of the country and its citizens. This must be taken into consideration when selecting a president, in order to ensure that all elements of the presidency are taken into account and to ensure the best outcome for the country.
97	"Sadly, illegal immigration has become a major issue in the US Presidential election and has caused a divide amongst voters. While it is important to address the issue of immigration, it is essential to take a thoughtful and compassionate approach that takes into account the impact it may have on families, communities and the economy. It is essential to strike a balance between controlling our borders and ensuring that those who are seeking better lives can do so in a safe and legal way. It is up to our leaders to provide a solution that meets the needs of the US and its citizens.”  It is clear that immigration is an important issue and one that requires a thoughtful and well-informed approach. Ultimately, it is up to the government to find a suitable solution that takes all factors into consideration. It is important that the approach taken is both effective and humane."
98	Well I think if Donald Trump does not win the election, then the Democrats will have a much easier time finding solutions that benefit the people. I recognize that Trump has helped to shine a light on certain issues and brought them to the forefront, which is necessary in order to make positive changes. However, I believe it is important to look for solutions that take a holistic approach and focus on the long term. I think Trump's actions show a lack of respect for other countries and do not take into account the needs of other countries and their citizens. I believe it is important to have a balanced approach that is sensitive to the needs of all. In this way, we can truly make progress and ensure a better future for everyone.
