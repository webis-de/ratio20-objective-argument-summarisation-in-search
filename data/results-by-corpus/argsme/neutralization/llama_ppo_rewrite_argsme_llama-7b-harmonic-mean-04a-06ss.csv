0	Climate change clearly does not exist, here are reasons why: (1) Exhaling Carbon Dioxide is no clear threat to our climate, we just breathe it out, our cars do it too (2) It is a conspiracy (3) There are no sources to back your statement up Here are my sources on how "Climate Change" doesn't exist: (1) http://www.globalclimatescam.com... (2) http://www.newsmax.com... (3) https://en.wikipedia.org... These 3 sources tell you that climate change is fake, first one tells you the top 10 reasons why climate change does not exist, the second, facts about this "global warming" hoax; And finally, The third source tells you the entire conspiracy that "Climate Change exists".
1	A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. " But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen." [0] Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. "in a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, led to an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke." [1] "The association between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events is now well established. " [2] "The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures." [3] "The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al " [4] My argument is succinct and should prove that man-made climate change is extremely likely to exist.

2	My position on climate change is that not only do I believe in it but I believe it is man caused. I will start My opening argument to state that global warming is a proven fact and anyone that disagrees with me is ignorant on this subject. 97% of scientists believe that climate change is primarily human caused. Also the arguments stated by Human-caused climate change deniers are pointless and not fact driven. I wish my opponent the best of luck. Sources(s): Shaftel, H. (Ed.). (2012, January 5). Global Climate Change: Consensus. Retrieved February 3, 2015, from https://climate.nasa.gov...
3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers. But they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe.   Climate change is being caused by human activity. There are a limited number of circumstances under which free speech can be restricted. One of them is child pornography. The reason that can be banned with violating the 1st Amendment is the harm caused to children in the production of child porn is of such magnitude the normal means of combating bad speech-- more speech is not adequate or sufficient.   The ignorance peddled by climate change deniers many of whom like child pornographers do so for greed. These will include teenagers sent to fight the increasing number of wars and conflicts which will likely occur. Yes the risk is too high to allow this ignorance to continue to be peddled. Should we jail people who write and utter falsehoods about climate change? If need be yes.
4	I'll accept this challenge. First, I should ask to be clear: When you say "climate change is a fraud," are you referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change or all climate change? If it is the former, I won't waste time explaining all the evidence that the globe is, in fact, Warming at an unprecedented rate and instead go straight into attribution. If, however, you don't think the globe is really warming at an unprecedented rate, I'm happy to go into the evidence for it. Moreover, "fraud" implies more than just the majority of scientists being wrong (i.e. Misinterpreting the evidence) but also that they are intentionally lying. This is a big claim given the number of scientists who support the concept of anthropogenic climate change and one that incurs its own burden of proof. See you some time in the next 72 hours.
5	Climate change is real and human-caused. The local weather may change but the global climate stays basically the same. The oceans are not rising either. The IPCC is a legitimate organization that has legitimate goals. You can and should trust any scientist who tells you that the climate is changing. The science of human-caused climate change is sound and based on solid evidence. There is proof that climate change is real and happening.  2. It's mathematically possible and against the laws of physics that a tiny human mass can effect the larger Earth mass, but the amount of CO2 that humans release can and does affect the global temperature. 3. The properties of CO2 are such that it can create global warming on the scale indicated by scientists. This is because CO2 reaches its saturation point at 80 parts / million and reflects some significant amount of heat after this point is reached. 4. Maurice Strong is not the main person that started this whole climate frenzy movement and was not found to be corrupt. He fled to the US to hide from the global police. 5. Climate data fraud. Tree rings used as evidence when it is known that tree ring growth is not an accurate measurement of temperature. "Hide the decline" email by Phil Jones. Mike's trick. Hockey stick nonsense. Inverted graphs. Etc. There, That should keep you busy for a while. Refute all these points. Good luck.
6	Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.  My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1"C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7"F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax. I await my opponent's argument!
7	I propose that climate change is a real and urgent issue, and that the people who support it are all real and genuine. The science of human-caused climate change is sound and based on accurate facts and evidence. There is proof that climate change is all based on scientific facts and evidence, not fraudulent news started by Obama & crew. Those people who listen to that scientist are on the right track.   Video evidence - The In-depth Story Behind A Climate Fraud. The 97% consensus fraud.   It's mathematically impossible and against the laws of physics that a tiny human mass verses huge Earth mass, That the former can effect the latter.   The properties of CO2 are such that it can't create global warming on the scale indicated by scientists. This is because CO2 reaches it's saturation point at 80 parts / million and doesn't reflect any significant amount of heat after this point is reached.   Maurice Strong is the main person that started this whole climate frenzy movement and was found to be corrupt and fled to China to hide from the global police.   Climate data fraud. Tree rings used as evidence when it is known that tree ring growth is not an accurate measurement of temperature. "Hide the decline" email by Phil Jones. Mike's trick. Hockey stick nonsense. Inverted graphs. Etc. There, That should keep you busy for a while. Refute all these points. Good luck.
8	The task at hand is to "contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent." From a common definition, anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from human beings on nature. Then, from common usage, "climate change" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC, 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is more than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is perfect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed.
9	Round two arguments. First, the science is settled, this is a political debate that deniers try to make look like a scientific debate. Fact: There is a 97% consensus on climate change. Climate scientists are the experts of experts in their field. A consilience of evidence, social calibration, and social diversity exist. Myth: 31,000 scientists signed a petition so therefore there is no consensus. Fallacy: Fake experts, as the expertise increases so does agreement. Co2 is at the highest it has been in over 800,000 years. Temperatures are rising. Glaciers are overall losing mass. Humans fingerprints show humans are extremely likely to be causing these events. Burning of fossil fuels and the released Co2 is the main driver of climate change. Thank you.
10	Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate I do not pretend to stand for all of feminism seeing as there are many different sects of the movement. I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. Want to do away with the dehumanization of women in pornography<br> Now, I will be arguing from the perspective of Antiporn and Cultural feminism. This movement advocates that pornography objectifies women and dehumanizes them, therefore creating a gender power imbalance. Thus, we should make an effort to do away with this dehumanization of women in pornography. You say that feminism has "gone too far," but before we can continue, give me more to chew on.
11	Feminism Has NO gender. I am a Man And I am A Feminist. Feminism by definition stands up for all my perspectives, ambitions, desires and behaviours. Feminism is the ACT of Advocating (though perhaps passively in some circumstances) against Woman Abuse, and EVERYTHING which leads to women being slandered - Including False propaganda of Feminism by SLuts who enable womanizers and glorify perverts such as homosexuality. { It is not an act of feminism to defend a slut who enabled an adulterous man. That WOULD be counter productive. } I am Pro Feminism, that is why I accepted this debate. And Feminism has no gender, Nor Negative attributes.
12	Con has argued dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. Con's presented only one argument in this entire debate — "Since 'masculinism' is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy." — without giving any evidence to back the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Furthermore, Con didn't provide any source of definition for Masculinism, so Con's argument is not sound. I have offered six authoritative sources stating that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women. I am for equality between men and women. I am for Feminism. According to Con, Con is an "equalist" and is "for the rights of men AND women". Therefore, Con is also for Feminism. The statement of debate is "Feminism". I have proven I am Pro. I have proven Con is not Con.
13	You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. Um... No, that's not what feminism is at all. Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define "the patriarchy". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about "calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that "false rape reports" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.
14	As per the rules of the debate as set by my opponent, this will be my final argument. Since my opponent has failed to formulate a response, I see little need to elaborate much on my previous post. I will merely offer a brief summary of my arguments and this debate as a whole. My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don't consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically concedes the debate by stating "in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city." Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let's ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me this debate. I would like to thank the readers for taking the time to read this debate.
15	I agree with you that feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but you must consider the conditions of the countries economy and social interaction because such a movement where they say one day "Women now have the ability of free will under no circumstances can there husbands control what they do." This could start massive revolts that would massacre women and could cause a rebellion against these weak 3rd world countries. Before feminism even comes to these countries, slow progressive changes must be made to deal with each conflict differently. You are very correct that feminism is no longer needed in 1st world countries like the US, but first democracy and peace must reach these areas. Much of these middle eastern countries make these laws due to Islamic influence, as Muslims believe that a woman must cover herself and listen to her husband. What these countries misinterpreted is how Islam doesn't state that husbands have complete control over their wives. Maybe a large religious event where a powerful person gives a touching speech talking about the word of Allah and how his true vision of an Islamic society would be that warms the hearts of Islamic country leaders and somehow influences them to establish laws that establish if not democratic rights or laws, feminism in the country.
16	Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. First off, I reject your definition of feminism. I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism. I also reject your premise, because I stated in my first argument that MODERN feminism is harmful. My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes. Your first argument is invalid, because I never said that men and women weren't intellectually equal (although they generally don't have as much physical strength as men do, which I will provide the proof for below). And again, you can't blame the phrasing of the Declaration of Independence on men born two centuries after it was created. I don't think you have won this debate. Maybe I am wrong though. Maybe you can prove yourself in the second round. Good luck (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... (source for men's vs. women's strength))
17	Hi everyone I'm Ilan and I am not a feminist. Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a "sexist" or "a rape apologist" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no if ands and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is "believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities." and that for feminism is "the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.". Now that we have established some ground I can really get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, be whatever the hell that you want, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. One major issue that men face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. I have never in my life met a feminist that has agreed with the statement "Prostate cancer is a feminist issue" because quite frankly it is not. Many feminists also like to say that MRAs (Men's Rights Activists) are the ones that should be campaigning for male problems but if it really is for everyone then why does feminism not cover everybody's problems. Here I have merely scratched the surface of male problems that feminism does not address such as the fact that 4 times more men commit suicide than women or that 70% of homeless people are estimated to be men or the significantly less jail time for female rapists than men. I could go on but I want to hear what everyone else has to say about this! I thank you for hearing out what I had to say if you made it this far and hope you all have a wonderful day.
18	First to answer the attack on Observation One: Pro's response to this was that we are not in Iraq. This piece of evidence was from 2010, and since then nothing has changed as we still have people supporting feminism. During the Iraq war, it was true that they were more likely to be raped than shot. If we were in Iraq today it would still stand. Next he said he was never talking about pornography, however it can be inferred from his opener. Now the big argument he made in this last round was that all my arguments were about equal rights, not feminism. However, this argument is flawed. A quick google search indicates the definition of feminism is "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men." This means that feminism, by its very definition means equal rights to women. Pro admitted they are pro equal rights, so therefore, by the very definition of feminism, they are pro feminism. Additionally, note Observation 2 and Advantages 1 and 2 were untouched in the last round, which is reason alone to vote for con. In conclusion, by the definition of feminism, pro conceded that feminism is good, as well as not denying that feminism is bad by not attacking my advantages of feminism.
19	First off, I did some searching, and the Marriam-Webster dictionary is made in liberal Massachusetts. They clearly bended the definition to serve their needs. I don't agree with that definition. You see, if a said a was a "masculinist", people would say that I'm male supremacist, but if I called myself a feminist, I would be called a "champion of rights". So, since "masculinism" is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy. I consider myself an "equalist". Feminism today is so twisted and hypocritical today, that it is best to abandon it. I am for the rights of men AND women, not JUST women, and not ONLY men.
20	"The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me? There is nothing between," says Mother Teresa. Abortion, what does this really mean? The definition of abortion is the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks. About 42 million women in the entire world with unintended pregnancies choose abortion. Abortion is a big controversial topic, people believe abortion should be illegal and others think it should stay legal. Why would someone want to kill an innocent little life? It"s not their fault people made mistakes and now they"re the ones having to pay for it. Abortion should be illegal because abortions are not safe, laws are protecting unborn babies, and fetuses can feel pain. Abortion should have never been legal.
21	Thank you to my opponent for yet another debate on the topic of abortion. The resolution is "Abortion" and I shall argue in support of the affirmative. To begin, I submit the definition of abortion by Medicine.net Medical Dictionary: Abortion: In medicine, an abortion is the premature exit of the products of conception (the fetus, fetal membranes, and placenta) from the uterus. It is the loss of a pregnancy and does not refer to why that pregnancy was lost. http://www.medterms.com... In addition, here is the wikipedia article in which the introduction defines abortion in the same manner: http://en.wikipedia.org... Since my opponent has used his first round to merely ask for my opening statement and did not clarify the resolution or offer any sort of framing, I will assume that my opponent is trying to affirm "abortion" in general. I start by arguing that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds. 1. Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries. Though this is a form of abortion, I argue that it should in no way be supported. 4. Dangerous abortions I am against many forms of abortion for health reasons. The use of coat hangers to stimulate an abortion, for example. Or throwing oneself off a flight of stairs. Or going to a back-alley abortionist that doubles as a tattoo parlor. These are all very dangerous ways of abortion. I look forward to my opponent's rebuttal. Thank you.
22	-ABORTION- Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death.[1] An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages. I have a question for you do you believe in torturing terrorist? (if the answer is no) If you said no you are a moron because you believe in killing gods perfectly harmless creations for nothing and not killing a terrorist for terrorizing our country. Do you believe in the death sentence? If you said no your killing a baby for Nothing. Yes you are killing it you stop its heart from beating it. What do you think god and Jesus our lord and savior think about that. If you are atheist please Google john 3:16

25	Abortion is needed to control the population so that the population doesn't get too excess. By the 22 century, the population estimated to be 11.2 billion people and if abortion were illegal, the population would be so much higher. If our country stops the use of abortion, we will end like china, forcing women that don't want to have an abortion to have an abortion to control the population. When women are forced to get abortions, a lot of women commit suicide. Women have a higher rate of suicide in China because of this reason and in almost every other country, men have a higher rate of suicide. If abortion were illegal, the population would grow tremendously, causing abortion to be forced onto women later in life, which will increase the suicide rate of women. http://www.allgirlsallowed.org...
26	I thank my opponent for his response to my previous statement.  "Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate" (I argue this statement) As a matter of fact it is relevant to this debate. The topic we are discussing is abortion and whether it should be accepted or not. Clearly anyone who is kicked in the stomach has witnessed an act of assault. Abortion is only abortion if it is considered to be or not to be by the child carrier. If not considered abortion, it is only a mere act of assault. This can happen to anyone. I now argue my opponent's ideology of the "morning after pill". Referring back to my opponent's definition of abortion, the morning after pill is also another form of abortion. It all eliminates the infant correct? Therefore, my opponent provided another form of abortion that he stated is the solution to pregnancy even though he is supposed to argue against it. Any act of the mother eliminating her child would be classified as abortion only if it is intended by the carrier. Immorality: No, I was not intending it to fall under my opponent's four categories. I was only preventing that from being argued. It may not be relevant to the four types of abortion, but it is relevant to the topic at hand.  what is right and wrong?: The people in this world have their own basic concept of what is right or wrong. This can also relate to morality. Every single person shares the same individual mindset, their own gathered ideas and opinions of what is right and wrong. I extend my argument referring to morality with only the slightest question...What is moral in this world? Certainly not shaving. This refers to the Bible. It is absolutely hypocritical for someone who shaves to say abortion is immoral. In addition to my opponent's remark about whether kicking a woman in the stomach is moral or not. Assault is not moral. But then again we are not talking about assault, we are talking about abortion. Why I did not respond to the other three categories of abortion, well that is the thing....I actually did in a general remark. Referring to my opponent's previous statements about morality, intentional abortion and teen pregnancy. I extend my previous arguments..... In conclusion, I affirm abortion as a way of preventing further difficulty in life with both the mother and child. Creating problems or preventing them with out the slightest sense of guilt. Thank you!
27	Rather than discussing the positives vs the negatives of abortion, con has simply claimed that "abortion" "enslaves" people into paying for their abortions. Would con be fine then if the woman had to pay for her own abortion? If so, then I don't see the problem; con would therefore agree that abortion is okay if the woman pays for it. Con's entire argument, however, about being "enslaved" would apply to the pro abortion side, not his side. In other words, con is arguing my side for me. If we became anti-abortion, then we'd all have to pay for unwanted babies that mother's were forced to have. This averages around 250k PER kid. http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Not only that, but this is simply the cost of raising a kid until he or she is 18. What if they can't find a job? Due to technology, we are moving AWAY from jobs, not towards jobs. We are already overpopulated as is; imagine what FORCING mother's to have kids they don't want would do to us. Talk about enslavement! We already have 100k orphans who are not adopted, and that's WITH allowing abortion. If we didn't allow abortion, that number could easily approach 1 million. https://showhope.org...
28	Most people that want to make abortion illegal do so out of ignorance and emotion. Research has shown that making abortion illegal does not reduce abortion but does increases maternal mortality. As to the mother's danger, Pregnancy has a major effect on a person's body and emotional state, And every pregnancy carries some risk of serious complication or death. The crucial decision to take on that risk"no matter how small"can only be decided by the pregnant person themselves. Not you and law enforcement . . . Women's lives, health, and basic human rights depend on the availability of abortion, And those are the only factors necessary to justify abortion.
29	This isn't your typical abortion debate. Because I've never had the 'opportunity' of being a pregnant lady, nor do I have the privilege of remembering my fetus days, I don't consider myself fit to actually judge as to whether abortion is OK or not. This is a debate as to how the morality of abortion should be judged. In other words, I will be debating that the morality of abortion should be determined by whether or not a fetus is sentient, while con will do something along the lines that the morality of abortion should be determined by deciding whether a fetus is a person or not. Go ahead and except. Unless your rationalmadman.
30	Thank you Pro for this interesting topic. "I think trump is life. Agree?" Before starting my own arguments let's define a few terms. trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit "called also trump card. [1] Life - the ability to grow, change, etc., that separates plants and animals from things like water or rocks [2] Now there are 7 qualifications in order for something to have life. They are as follows: It should maintain some balanced conditions in its inner structure Its structure is highly organized. It should be able to break down or build up nutrients to release or store energy based on need. This is called Metabolism It should grow, which means its structure changes as time goes by in an advantageous manner. It should be able to respond to environmental stimuli on demand (as opposed to adaptation, which occurs over time). It should be able to reproduce itself. [3] Now as far as I can tell a "trump" or "trump card" doesn't meet any of these requirements making my opponents statement "trump is life" false. [1] http://www.merriam-webster.com... [2] http://www.merriam-webster.com... [3] https://en.wikibooks.org...
31	Trump is the most openly racist Presidential candidate since pre Civil Rights. Source 1: (http://theweek.com...) here comes Donald Trump, who started his campaign by ranting about how Mexican immigrants are rapists and drug dealers (...) After a Black Lives Matter protester was punched and kicked at a Trump rally, Trump said "Maybe he should have been roughed up." And he retweeted a graphic with fake statistics about black people supposedly murdering whites, which turns out to have been created by a neo-Nazi. (...) the thing Trump is trying to communicate with this story. (...) Your Muslim friends and neighbors? They're not the assimilated, patriotic Americans they want you to believe. They're not regular people with jobs and families and lives like yours. They're a threat, people to be surveilled and harassed and hated and feared. (...) Racism has a significant impact both on the individuals who experience it and the wider community. Research shows that there are significant links between experiences of racism and discrimination and poor physical and mental health, reduced productivity and reduced life expectancy. Further, it is well-recognised that racism presents barriers to social and economic participation which can in turn cause social exclusion and entrench disadvantage, sometimes for generations. (...) It harbours mistrust. It incites hatred. It stops the word 'community' in its tracks. Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and will destroy the US. It destroys communities, causes crime, etc. Why would you EVER support Trump?
32	Here is the source I will be using: - http://todaysinfo.net... This website lists 13 reasons why Trump will make a great president. I am only going to copy and comment on two of them. 12. "Trump is planning to build a great, great wall (yes"two "greats") on our southern border between the U.S. and Mexico. The best part? He"s planning to have Mexico pay for that wall, and mark his words, "" I will immediately terminate President Obama"s illegal executive order on immigration."" "Plus, with less authentic delicious Mexican food here in the U.S., obesity rates will probably drop."   Regardless of Trump's racist bigotry used to appeal to an old, racist crowd, Immigration IS a problem here in the US and he plans to put an end to it. 1. "Why would Trump make the best president of all time? Because he said so. "I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, I tell you that. I"ll bring back our jobs from China, from Japan, from Mexico and from so many places. I"ll bring back our money." Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
33	First of all, why do you think Mr. Trump will be such a "great" president just so I know you aren't the kind of person who likes to talk about an opinion and not have anything to back it up. Trump is an inconsiderate jerk who thinks that he can say all the crap he likes to say about people and get away with it. He also talks about reducing our debt. Ask him how he can do that when he wants to build a wall around Mexico, which will: 1. Put us billions of dollars into more debt. 2. Make it ok to let him do without trying to actually TALK to the Mexicans and ask them to stop illegally immigrating into our country.
34	First of all, I support O'Malley, but that isn't important. It looks like this debate comes down to Trump's stance on immigration. I showed clear harms from racism - shattered communities, (look at Ferguson if you want proof lol) poor mental and physical health, economic downturns, etc. If Trump becomes president and embraces racism, all these impacts will go nationwide. My opponent has no response to this, so insofar as I can prove Trump is racist, you vote neg. And I showed clear evidence of that, but if you want more, here's how illegal immigrants are treated. Source 3: (https://www.revcom.us...) These Minutemen inspired by rightwing Republican Pat Buchanan's claim that urgent action is needed to preserve the U.S. as an ethnically white, Christian-European nation. (...) The cold-blooded vigilante attacks on immigrants aren't a new development. Ranchers in Arizona have killed undocumented immigrants for years. They have terrorized them, hunted them down with dogs, and handed them over to the Border Patrol at gunpoint. (...) they have developed deep ties with powerful forces high in the government"and are operating in the era where any paranoid appeal for more security quickly gets official backing and a public hearing. (...) Mile by mile, walls and barbed wire have cut off Mexico from the United States, forcing more and more immigrants to cross over in the dangerous desolate stretches of border in Arizona. It has created an intense conflict zone, as desperate immigrant workers try to cross and survive, and an intensified government crackdown hunts them through the dry hills to trap them, capture them, (...) this reactionary Minuteman movement has emerged to demand even more extreme and violent actions against the immigrants. They have criticized the proposals made by President Bush and Mexico's President Vicente Fox to create a legal program for bringing Mexican immigrants into the U.S. So these Minutemen kill and hunt down not only illegal immigrants, but also innocent Americans. Clearly more anti immigration laws will simply fuel more racism, and the death of innocent people. So since Trump will cause more terrible organizations like this to form, please vote neg - vote down Trump.
35	I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. In early 2015, he brought up the idea that the government should start making deals with hospitals to help low income Americans. Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices. Today, his official healthcare plan affirms that he supports a 100% free market system, where insurance companies must compete nationwide - the exact opposite of universal healthcare. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you'd be a criminal; the Bible says that we should stone our children if they are disobedient - which is considered murder, and murder is a crime. The video is basically anti-Trump propaganda with little to no factual information. SOURCES: http://www.politifact.com... https://www.donaldjtrump.com...

36	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Mostly because Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East and they've become rich. They even built a hotel making themselves a direct competitor of Trump Hotel. Trump is undeniably a great negotiator, and despite his outrageous public statements in the recent past, he knows how to navigate complex deals and convince a wide variety of industries, businesses, and investors to do what he wants and to work with him to achieve his goals. Trump isn't politically correct. He isn't afraid to say what he thinks, and he can certainly voice an opinion. If he has an issue with you, he will say it to your face. It'd be nice to have a politician in office with that level of transparency.
37	I accept. Before we begin I would like to clear some things up for the voters and provide definitions. There is no clear resolution so I will provide one after the definitions. Trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit President - (Definition 2) an officer appointed or elected to preside over an organized body of persons Full Resolution based off of definitions - A Card Trump For The President Of The World My stance is as follows: A Card Trump Should Not Be The President Of The World https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trump http://www.dictionary.com/browse/trump.
38	In round 2, I demolished everyone's source that Trump is a liar: WashPo's list is full of clearly non-lies. Probably nothing on their list is a real lie. My opponent's Round 2 response was just a rehash of his Round 1 rant. So, I will respond to some of the side comments.   Says who? Does WashPo have a tracker for Obama's lies, Bush's lies, Clinton's lies? -Nope. We can't know how his lying compares without having comparable lists.   This is my exact point: Trump is just another one of the everyone that lie. Why should his lies be tracked when no one else's have been? I assert that Trump doesn't lie in a manner worthy of special tracking. His lack of complete honesty is in line with the mainstream of US politicians and media outlets nowadays.
39	"Sadly...The American Dream... IS DEAD" It isn't! Not yet... but if he wins... it will be!. Hillary Clinton called Trump a racist and Trump responded: "Failing candidate Hillary Clinton, who is desperately trying to hold on to her lead in the democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, is knowingly putting out lies about my stance on illegal immigration. I said "Mexico is sending"" I"m not knocking immigration or immigrants, but rather am very critical of the country of Mexico for sending us people that they don"t want. Likewise I am very critical of illegal immigration and the tremendous problems including crime, which it causes. She is desperate, she is sad, and she is obviously very nervous when she has to revert to issues that have already been settled given the absolute accuracy of my statement. She speaks about "my tone" and that"s the problem with our country"s leaders. They are more worried about tone than results! It's not about being nice" it's about being competent. Hillary should spend more time producing her illegally hidden emails and less time trying to obfuscate a statement by me that is totally clear and obviously very much accepted by the public as true. I am honored, however, that she is attacking me, instead of Jeb Bush. Obviously she knows that JEB is no longer her real competition." He lied about Hillary being a sad excuse for a candidate. He lies unintentionally and finds it hard to stop. I know what you're thinking: "I need evidence!" This is a part of an article I found on a website: Donald Trump is a serial liar. Okay, to be a bit less Trumpian about it, he has trouble with the truth. If you look at Politifact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning site that examines candidates' pronouncements for accuracy, 76 percent of Trump's statements are rated either "mostly false," "false," or "pants on fire," which is to say off-the-charts false. By comparison, Hillary Clinton's total is 29 percent."
40	When you simply dismiss an opponent's arguments as "factoids and other junk," it is to be assumed that you have no rebuttal for them. Thus, unless you provide an adequate rebuttal in later rounds, you concede all of these points as true. I don't know what political correctness has to do with this debate; if you would be so kind as to explain so both of us have some context to argue off of, that would be nice. Just as a note--since the British people have now voted to leave the EU, I hope that it happens and that Britain does succeed in invoking Article 50. It's one thing to be against something passing and quite another to try to override the will of the people by undemocratic means. I respect the will of the British people and hope that the choice they made actually occurs. If I'm not mistaken, however, you titled this debate "Brexit" and I took the Con position. Does this not mean that I am arguing that the effects of Brexit will be mostly negative and you arguing that they will be positive?  Seeing as you don't appear to have made any actual arguments as to why a Brexit will be beneficial, I shall refrain from expanding my arguments this round, seeing as I have nothing to respond to.
41	Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to work the dirty jobs such as farming so migrants need to do it for them. [1] Let's Look at the facts. Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 Billion pounds or 0.3% of britains GDP. So for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%. But considering the UK makes 13% of it's GDP from selling commodties to the EU this seems unlikely. [2] The problem with this is that economists predict that the UK could lose up to 6% of It's GDP from leaving the EU which is much greater than 0.3% [3] This isn't even including additional costs for tarrifs that would amount to close to the cost for eu membership after free trade deals are abolished. [4] Also, Britain has complete control of their immigration policy so leaving would do almost nothing when it comes to immigration policy. Not to mention that 70% of Britain's population increase came from immigration. Limiting immigration radically could have some pernicious effects. [5] Clearly from this information, Brexit would have accomplished nothing in immigration and would hurt the UK economy in the long run.

42	Brexit will be beneficial for England. They will be able to close their border to the flood of migrants, keeping a close eye on illegal immigration from the Middle East. Also, this will save England millions in EU fees. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and they are countries that are well off and do not have to follow the rules imposed by the EU. Borders are made for a reason. By not being in the EU, England can close their border to the floods of migration that Europe is seeing and not have to follow the rules imposed by the EU but by laws and rules of each individual country. There is a reason why there are so many countries around the world and why Europe is divided into so many countries. The EU is trying to colonize Europe into one big nation. It is not going to work.
43	I appreciate your response, So here is my final debate round Security of the country is more important than trade. Just look at what is happening in the rest of Europe. The migrant crisis is reaching epic proportions all the way to France because the borders were open and the migrants came cross all borders unobstructed. From Italy and Turkey through the rest of open Europe through the poorer nations all heading for England the most prosperous country in the EU. A border crossing with northern and southern Ireland is also critical in keeping the IRA at bay and controlling movement of people. Open borders are a disaster for security reasons. It might be easier to cross borders for regular travelers but lets look at the Sicilian mafia, They are now free to roam all over Europe, The Russian mafia has open borders to travel to England right now and poison people with polonium. The Gypsies can roam all around Europe. And finally the migrants from the middle east including ISIS can freely cross from Turkey to anywhere in Europe. Everybody is complaining about Brexit until the bombs go off in France and England or a 1000 women are raped in Germany over the holidays because there is no control at the border. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and they are doing excellent. Not everyone needs to be in a big EU boys club. Countries all separated a long time ago because people couldn't get along. Yugoslavia split into 6 countries because they couldn't get along, Who says we need to make one big Europe country? Have we not learned from the Roman empire, From the Ottoman empire. Countries are created every decade in Africa, In the past in South America. Panama did not want to be part of Colombia so they created their own country with a border. Not having borders or having open borders is a bad idea. That's like not having a fence with your neighbor. And besides why should England pay 13 billion euros to the EU, How much is Romania and Bulgaria paying? Nothing. England is a rich prosperous country, They don't need to be part of the EU clan that is suffering from migrant invasions and terrorism. Besides other countries are pulling out too, Poland and Sweden mentioned they might pull out next. You can have your own country so why would you want to be under the thumb of the Hague and the big brother EU. England will prosper without the EU like they have done for hundreds of years just ask Switzerland and Norway about it. The EU is FAKE NEWS and bad and 50% of the British agree with me and want out.
44	I will first begin my addressing the rebuttals made by my opponent to defend my arguments. My opponent started off by accusing me of not understanding opportunity cost. Let me assure him that I have quite a good idea of what opportunity cost means. He then brings in some technical terms with the hopes of confusing us to believe in him. Basically, he brushes off my argument which is the net high costs of remaining in the EU by accusing my data as biased and claiming that the opportunity of free trade justifies the cash. We have to remember that the costs of remaining in the EU have been rising STEADILY these past few years. If it has just been rising the last couple of years, yes, we might still be optimistic. But the truth is we are starting to question how much of a benefit this supposed free trade is when the figures have continuously been rising. When you consider that these costs are almost at par with medical costs in Britain, how long can we trick ourselves into thinking that "you know, this is all for free trade. All this cost is justified." And that is why I brought up the countries Norway and Switzerland. These countries are proof that you can stay out of the EU without having to succumb to membership fees. I was not at all implying that Britain should adopt a Nordic model. Of course, as a country with values of its own, they should negotiate a different treaty and a different model that suits them. Finally, I agree that America has no rights to comment on the Brexit. I was in no way implying that we should 'make Britain great again' as per Trump's model. And I never said that we should disallow refugees/migrants. I said that we should be able to draw our own laws up and not follow Brussel's laws, if for nothing else other than to maintain Britain's standing in the eyes of the world as an independent and strong nation.
45	My opponent seems to be missing the point. I'm not saying one shouldn't use sources. What I'm saying is that when you do use a source, you need to use quotation marks, and reference your source. If you don't, you're guilty of plagiarism. REBUTTAL I'm glad to see my opponent has finally made an original argument. Having said that, I hate you inform him that he went too far the other way. This time he's fallen into a logical fallacy known as a "bare assertion" fallacy. [1] This is when someone makes a claim without providing any substantiation. With this in mind, I ask the voters to reject his arguments as the baseless claims that they are. NEGATIVE CASE According to India's Secretary General of Industry, A. Didan Singh, "We firmly believe that leaving the EU would create considerable uncertainty for Indian businesses engaged with UK and would possibly have an adverse impact on investment and movement of professionals to the UK." [2] Finally, England leaving the EU could lead to the volatility of the pound. This could lead to increased risk for businesses within India. [3] Sources: 1. https://logfall.wordpress.com... 2. http://m.economictimes.com... 3. Ibid
46	The United Kingdom needs to be separated from the European Union, as people in England are facing a lot of issues due to migration from other countries in search of jobs, leading to an increase in the unemployment level, which affects people's quality of life. This could impede England's ability to provide for its citizens' education, health, and daily living. Although establishing new industries may be difficult, this would provide employment opportunities for the people of England, allowing them to find jobs and trade with other countries, which would increase employment.
47	Ok, let's agree with the opposition. Let's say that the costs incurred when Britain has to trade with each country separately is higher than the membership fee of being in EU. First of all, economic experts themselves cannot agree whether which scenario is going to incur more cost, especially when you consider that even if Britain does leave the EU it is going to take at least 2 years to gradually leave the EU and to finalise new laws and trade agreements. But when the problem is happening now, we cannot continue to ignore it without trying something new. Britain has been in the EU for too long and a new way of doing things, a change from the old ways deserve at least a 'trial period' to enable us to work things out. My opponent then argues terrorist ideas are home grown, not brought in and therefore an emphasis should be on the education system. I simply cannot agree with this. The fact that most terrorists have radical Islamic views are because they are from Islamic descent. To mitigate this problem, you can't bring in more people from Islamic countries (assuming this is Syria, Iraq etc) and expect that you know, nothing is going to happen and we're all going to live happy in a multicultural society. Which is exactly why, at this period in history with influx of migrants from Muslim countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel, we need to have more control over our borders. It is our concern that Brussels will force us to terms that will impact our community, particularly with regards to the public's sensitivity about muslims and terrorism. The fact that member states can share info to me is not at all a good reason to remain in the EU. The war on terrorism is a war fought collectively by all countries whether or not we remain in EU. America, Canada, Australia all non-EU countries contribute to our info on potential terrorist threats. And when we still cannot prevent incidents like that in Sydney and Paris, we should not pretend that just by sharing info we can solve terrorism altogether. Notice that I am not at all saying that all Muslims are terrorists. I am saying that we have to take the necessary precautionary steps with the knowledge that most terrorists are muslims. Britain leaving the EU does not mean we will leave our collective effort with other countries on the war on terrorism. I have certainly enjoyed this debate and I thank my opponent for his worthy assessments and for his time. Vote Government. Vote for Independence.
48	My opponent's debate technique is awful. I posted so much evidence and even gave sources to the evidence...I'm not even going to debate you from your last post since you only bashed the integrity of my information which is clearly there, well stated, and that has proof given from my direct sources that are reliable. You have refused to even look at the EU constitution, so I will link it here: http://europa.eu... Final Statement: I believe in independence. It is strange, hard to come by, and is difficult to attain, but it is there, and the UK is grabbing it in a historical way. I know it will be difficult at first and I know there are people who are skeptical, but I truly believe with all of my being that it will be 100% worth it in the end when the UK can look at themselves as a thriving independent country in a world where independence doesn't come by very often. The news can say all they want, but based upon the past, independence has always garnered self sufficiency, and that is something worth attaining in my book. I believe in a more free and independent UK, and I believe in the country, so much so that I have no doubt they will make careful and well thought out decisions for their future as an independent body. As to my debate competitor: I am sorry you didn't find my information helpful...I don't know how to give you more evidence than I already have. If you decide not to read the EU constitution or the WTO, or any links of information that I gave to you, then my friend, you are purposefully blinding yourself to my debate which clearly answered all of your questions that you gave. But thanks anyway for debating the subject, it has been invigorating and full of knowledge.
49	First of all I would like to make my "map points" as to why I am oppose to the death penalty. 1. The cost One my argue by logic that the cost is much higher for life imprisonment because you would have to feed him everyday etc.... for the rest of their lives right. # A 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution (median cost $1.26 million). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration (median cost $740,000). (December 2003 Survey by the Kansas Legislative Post Audit) # In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment. (2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research) # In Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case. (Urban Institute, The Cost of the Death Penalty in Maryland, March 2008) # In California the current system costs $137 million per year; it would cost $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty. Innocence I will start off with a quote from Governor George Ryan of Illinois "I cannot support a system which, in its administration, has proven so fraught with error and has come so close to the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life... Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate." Since 1973, 130 people have been released from death rows throughout the country due to evidence of their wrongful convictions. In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row. 3. Death Penalty does not help anything There are no proven records that say that states that have the death penalty have lower crimes rates of any sort. People do not think right before they shot a guy in the face. "Oh wait, this state has the death penalty". Actually, states that do not have the death penalty have lower crime rates http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... 4. Would you agree that spending 23 hours in the day for the rest of your life in a 6 ft" by 6 ft" box thinking about what you have done, letting the misery eat you away for the rest of your life is worse then dyeing 5. And shouldn't the state be considered a murderer for killing someone as well
50	Opening Arguments : The system of law and order is all about justice but where do draw the line to were we become the very evil we wish to destroy. Murder is murder and capital punishment is just that murder, simple to just kill killers but what does that make you? It makes you a killer but with public opinion on your side and a notion of justice which isn't the case. Why is it that America holds a sanctity for life, and yet kill people for killing people how does that make sense its hypocritical. Case: 1. The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However it doesn't work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but then proven innocent after the sentence has already been carried out the government just goes oops sorry. 2. Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled "Death Penalty and Sentencing Information," wrote: "Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP." I await response...
51	Rebuttal 1: Why not just do it with a firing squad? Let them donate the guns and ammunition to kill them. Let the family or concerned citizens execute them or you can just hang them or use the electric chair. All of these are cost efficient ways of executing the death penalty. My opponent may also state that the trial will take longer, but the trial is going to cost money anyways. Death penalty or no death penalty. We can shorten the trials. My opponent also needs to take into account how much money it takes to feed someone for life. Rebuttal 2: These are just taken by citizens who have not witnessed the death penalty and don't know the effect of the death penalty. You also fail to understand the variety of states. States have different punishment structures. You also have to take into account gun control and general crime in the area. Seriously who ever heard a serious news story coming from Alaska? Then you have Texas, Louisiana and Alabama, all who are against gun control. Here are the crimes committed in Texas. (1) with the crimes committed in Minnesota, (2) you will see that Minnesota have generally less crime, whether it be assault, or property, than Texas. You also have to take into account gun control and general crime in the area. Rebuttal 3: You have one case where the U.S got it wrong. The burning of the DNA test could've just been an error. That is not a problem with the death penalty. it is a problem with the jobs the cops do on the trial, and can easily be fixed. Rebuttal 4: Well, I have to give him this statement because a lot has changed.... Nope! Murder was still murder back then, as it is now. For a source, read in a 6th grade history book. Rebuttal 5: MY OPPONENT HAS ADDMITED THAT THE DEATH PENALTY DETURED CRIME. In states with more murders, the death penalty has helped lower like Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. These are where many murders happen, and they have started to go down. So, a main chunk of that is the states with the death penalty. Then I ask you this, why do criminals, when they go to court, ask for life and not death. People commit stupid things because YOLO. People commit suicide because they are depressed. people join the military to get out of trouble, for structure, and pride in our nation. Ladies And Gentleman, I have proved that: Murders do go down as executions rise Death Penalty is cost-efficient Removing the death penalty will have negative effects The death penalty is morally justified
52	The death penalty has a purpose. People who have committed heinous crimes, such as mass murderers, cannot be imprisoned - they pose a threat of continuing to kill if they are not executed. The death penalty serves as an effective deterrent of future crimes, while imprisonment for murder averages 12 years in Australia, meaning many murderers are set free and able to commit further crimes. Benefits of the death penalty include decreased overpopulation in jails, the fear it imposes on other criminals, and the avenging of innocent lives. Without the death penalty, crime rates could rise due to an overpopulation of criminals and the fear of citizens. It is up to you now.
53	My opponent speaks no form of fact or statistic but morally on his/her opinion. I could sit here and talk about how I think the death penalty is good. But i'm not using facts or sources. If you need a reason on why the death penalty is a good idea; here are a few. One small but important reason on why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money. Another reason why the death penalty is a good idea, Once a criminal is executed, he cannot kill again. The case for this would be Kenneth Allen McDuff who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970's. His sentence was commuted to life and he was eventually released on parole and killed again. He has since been executed My final reason for this round is that the death penalty is actually a very good deterrence. If you look at this link: http://www.prodeathpenalty.com... You see a chart. The chart is documenting the number of yearly homicide rate per 100,000 population. The chart also documents the years 1950-2002. Lastly, the chart documents the yearly number of executions. The death penalty is actually considered a deterrent.
54	For the most part, these are correct, although there are some grey areas, but do not concern yourself with that. One mistake i made is that in some cases the death penalty is not COMPLETELY painless, but i was wanting to make the point that in most cases, it's less painful than a lot of deaths. "The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything some families struggle for, for free, and thats fair? And that doesn't waste money? If a person is sentenced to life in prison at age 37, at age 77, on average, it will cost a state more than $4 million dollars. (http://www.phoenix.edu...) I would like an explanation on how the death penalty costs more. "Innocent people are too often executed". Please show me cases where people are wrongly executed in the last 20 years or so. The death penalty is not used nearly as much, so i would like some elabortation. "The death penalty is applied in an unfair manner". I must have elabortation on this also. Another point i must make, the death penalty is a source of intimidation. If someone knows the death penalty is strictly enforced, more than likely that person will think twice about committing the crime. Its common sense, if someone understands that their life will be taken if they take someone else's life, less crimes will be committed. Now the death penalty is used more and more lightly and criminals know that more than likely nothing too terribly harmful will happen if they were to commit crimes. The justice system is becoming more and more relax and the death penalty is one example. My Dad is a police officer and even he states that the justice department is not punishing criminals the way criminals should be punished.
55	Ahhh, the death penalty. The government taking someone's life because they took someone else's life. What obvious hypocrisy. I disagree with the death penalty because it is immoral. First, the death penalty implies that a jury of twelve people is not qualified to take life into their own hands. Does this mean that mob execution should also be made legal? Second, the death penalty becomes intolerable the very moment that someone is wrongly convicted. Death is, if anything, permanent. If someone is wrongly convicted and sent to life in prison its horrible, but if someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, then an innocent person is MURDERED. How can this be moral?
56	Ok how can you say that it is usual to strap a person down to a table and inject him with poisons that will kill him. how is it usual to strap a person to a chair with sponges up there buts and masks over there face to keep them from vomiting and craping all over the place while your send thousands of volts through there body there is not anything usual about that. when on death row you have a unlimited amout of appeals that are all paid for by our court systems. plus various other expences so yes even an 18 yr old sitting in jail for the rest of there life is cheaper then the death penalty. infact it cost.   At the trial level, death penalty cases are estimated to generate roughly $470,000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty and costs of $47,000 to $70,000 for court personnel.  On direct appeal, the cost of appellate defense averages $100,000 more in death penalty cases, than in non-death penalty murder cases.   Personal restraint petitions filed in death penalty cases on average cost an additional$137,000 in public defense costs.  this came from (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...) which actually goes more in debth but it actually cost about 3 times more to put someone to death when innocent people die that is an issue with the death penalty. because if the death penalty was not used then those people would have a chance to prove. the death penalty is too perminate.  isn't life enough because studies show that people when kept away from other people go crazy and nuts litterally. and there life is over anyway so this is a worse punishment.
57	I deem the death penalty to be necessary. Morally, it is senseless that a serial killer would not face death as a punishment for their multiple crimes. Again, I could go into the devastational effects on the families of the victims, which harms many more people than it would the family of a serial killer, but you would argue I would be creating more pain by killing the killer. I cannot understand why a family would continue to support said killer, however it may happen. You have discounted economics and all other sensible retort I may have had, so it would be pointless me highlighting the economic benefits of the death penalty. You may personally be opposed to the death penalty, but, as is apparent in the Unite States, the people evidently want the death penalty, else they would proposition the banishment in their own state. Regardless if it actually deters crime or not, "the majority" want the death penalty: http://www.gallup.com... The above is one example of a poll, and there are more to be found should you require . I concede that the Government has too many powers as it stands, however if they are to maintain any degree of PERCEPTION of justice, it would be a wise move to include the death penalty. Regardless of its effectiveness, it still puts the public mind at ease. All too commonly, we read comments in newspapers referencing the death penalty and the revival of it. To put my position bluntly, I will use an example. If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and letting them sizzle in 100 degree heat in the desert of Arizona, I would be opposed to the death penalty. However, this is not the case, most especially here in Britain. Some prisons are palatial. If the "Arpaio model" was adopted, I would deem that apt and just punishment, considering their life would be in more misery than if they were dead. That is certainly punishment in the true sense of the word. For as long as Britain continues to send prisoners to tax-funded 5* hotels, I deem the death penalty a worthy inclusion to the system.
58	First I have to say sorry to my opponent for one missing the second round resulting in a forfeit. Second, for the lack of my free time I cannot give this argument my full effort, but will still try to convince the viewers of my position. 1) I agree that life imprisonment could easily be interpreted as cruel and unusual, however, with the death penalty, society focuses on vengeance and punishment, but with life imprisonment we can focus on rehabilitation and forgiveness. The death penalty gives the accused no chance of turning their life around, and is often sought out of vengeance of families of the victims, however the death penalty brings little to no closure of the families. These botched executions are unacceptable and because there is no humane method of killing, none shall be used. 2) As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. My opponent argues that trials shall be done faster and more efficiently, however that will just result in more mistakes, cause after all, we are all human, we all make mistakes, not just criminals. 3) I accept my opponent's argument that use of the death penalty doesn't correlate with murder rates, however I still state that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent. My opponent argues that more use of the death penalty would result in better deterrence, I admit this is possible, but it would not be a good thing for society, which is the original argument. An excessive use of the death penalty creates fear in society, which would be one method of deterrence, however with life imprisonment and the injection of morals into society. That way, society as a whole could get a better grasp on what is right and wrong. 4) Ok, all I have is one question: How many innocent people can be executed before the death penalty should stop being used? 5) The video doesn't relate to any one point, I feel that it helps express my overall feeling of the topic. http://www.youtube.com...
59	Google makes our lives better to take away our freedom. Google is releasing Google classroom and cars. If everyone uses Google classroom, every document would be on the internet and paper would be like extinct. When they have all the education, they will have the ability to change it. Google car, Google classroom, Google fiber, etc. When everything becomes Google, they can simply control us. A guy said (I don't remember his name) "if Google buys Walmart, they can take over the world." They would have access to our food and what we buy and what we are interested in. Isn't that scary? Google wants us to think like Google and that is how they will take over the world.
60	"Google gets an average of 188 Million visitors a day. Bing gets a measly 60 million a day. If Bing is better than Google, how come Google gets more visitors?" Just because Google gets more visitors, that doesn't mean it's necessarily better! Google has just been around longer, so Bing is starting to catch up. "As for Bing sounding better than Google, I'm going to have to disagree ;)." Think about it. The word Bing! sounds all happy and jumpy while Gooooooooooogle sounds more like an echo in a cemetery. "Con said "33% of Google users saying they'd be using Bing more often after taking part in the tests." This actually bolsters my case, because it shows that 67% of people would not ever use Bing instead of Google." It doesn't show that 67% of people will never ever use Bing instead of Google, on the website where I got my info, it didn't say anything about the rest of the people liking Google better than Bing. For all I know, the rest of them might only use Bing now!

62	My opponent has failed to refute any point that I have made therefore I am lead to believe that he is conceding this debate. He also states: "SO I think that some people just use google for there own inapropriate things." If Google was really the best search engine then why would there be things such as this, I think not. If my opponent proceeds to refute my points in the next round then I shall proceed to post the following arguments.  1) Google plagiarism (or phishing)  2) Google traffic view  3) More and more and more Google safety flaws.
63	Bing isn't being properly judged. Nearly every individual who prefers Google to Bing is a biased party. This is because those who hate Bing often use Google and never use Bing. Google "fan-boys" don't really know what Bing has to offer, and in many cases, have either never, or very rarely, ever used The Bing Engine, and thus, are ineligible to compare the two. I"m sure there"s a psychological term for it; there"s a cognitive "firewall" and almost "irrational" belief that appears to protect Google against competitors" claims. The competition really isn"t "just a click away." Microsoft continues to run online its Pepsi-Challenge style ads "Bing It On," in which a majority of users prefer Bing in a "blind comparison test" with Google. Despite the commercials and despite Microsoft reporting that after extensive testing users preferred Bing 2:1, people generally express skepticism <aurl=http://www.youtube.com>http://www.youtube.com/</a>.
64	The issue with the line of argument on the right is: a) Google doesn’t block results for ‘Authorities on subjects” if someone wants an article from the New Scientist, all one has to do is type in ‘New Scientist”alongside their search search query. b) Is the issue that Google is an-ultimate-truth-selling authority or that it challenges existing/established authorities such as The Economist on Economics? c) This is how the largely capitalist world works, monopolies/diopolies exist and kill off potential competition. Startups need funds, investment leads to profit/loss, those who can stave off risk and make smart choices and therefore profit win and others lose out. Google is simply protecting its assets/turf, just like every other existing company in the world.
65	[[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/micro-markets/google-wins-as-newspapers-battle/866?tag=content;siu-container]] This just leaves us with the matter of defining what “It’s business” is, is any company paying Google for result slots "It's business"? Established authorities in various subject areas have the money and resources to get top slots if they want them or maybe they’re comfortable in already being in a vied-for position and are more concerned with protecting copyright/patents than in being accessible to gullible children who don't trust their parents (I sense an oxymoron here).
66	Google Glass is a new technology that changes the way we interact with and learn material. It is another avenue for people to cheat on tests but people already cheat on tests. With the creation of each new technology it is the responsibility of the educator to adapt new methods of instruction. There is still a level of learning that needs to take place in order to use Google Glass on a test. Additionally, there is the argument that testing is ineffective as a learning tool and should only be used to help teachers adapt their teaching method. Perhaps more learning could take place in public schools if children had used Google Glass in a productive way.
67	So that we may set the platform for this debate, I would like to "reword" the argument statement to -- "Is the Google Review Rating System good or bad? " I would also add that, This is not necessarily the statement I agree with, More so what can be inferred from the context of the debate. Do you agree? As I understand it, But feel free to correct me if I am wrong. These are your supporting arguments to the argument statement above. 1) All reviews are 100 percent safe. 2) Guaranteed ranking on your Google business, Maps, And places 3) It"s a significant component of any prosperous marketing campaign. Do you agree? As it is my turn for a statement, I would first like to object to the following. 1) In your statement you are making an assumption that "All" is "safe". I would say that it is not possible to have all reviews are safe, Because there is no way to guarantee "safety". So that we are on the same page, The listed definition of safe is; protected from or not exposed to danger or risk; not likely to be harmed or lost. I would say there is no way to guarantee even the case where it is "not likely". Cities are designed to have all the available resources within reach for the populace to survive. These "Cities" have a common understanding of the way things need to work in order to "function". "Cities" have plenty of "safety" regulations that are governed by "law" which is enforced in order to "function". Even then of the countless number of ways that we have tried to guarantee safety through history--we have never been able to. "Crime" does exist within the populace and it is the only 100% certainty I see. So my objection to this statement would be, Logic cannot guarantee safety, Because there will always be an object that will purposefully circumvent commands that are expect a specific result to function. This I state as 100% guaranteed. If this is so, And bad and good are the measurement of success and the achievement of 100% is the criteria, Then I would say; The Google Review System is Bad. I would like to end this round with my single objection.
68	Even though the debate is to stop something, my opponent is clearly taking what would be the pro side to this, and therefore I will be arguing that Google+ should stay integrated with YouTube.   How so? Where is your evidence for this?  comment spamming I fail to see your point here, as the only comment spamming that I have witnessed since the integration of Google+ with YouTube is the "Bob's Army" spam that has only some into existence as a protest against the integration.  This isn't inherently the fault of Google, but rather certain peoples resistance to change.   Infinite characters I fail to see why this is a bad thing. Infinite characters allows a user to write out their entire comment in its entirety without having to write multiple comments to accomplish the same task. This is very beneficial if you are in an informal debate with someone on the site, and require a lot of characters to assert your argument. That is why the limits on this site can go as high as 10,000 characters, as people need that much space to write their full rebuttal.   force G+ account  It's a free account that does no harm to you. All you have to do is take a few minutes of your life to fill out the form and that is all. Nothing bad about that.    comment links It's a free account that does no harm to you. All you have to do is take a few minutes of your life to fill out the form and that is all. Nothing bad about that.  " and many more issues    Like what? 1. http://www.youtube.com...

69	To go vegan and stop the murder of these animals would not only counter the effects of our evolution but also destroy the industries involved in the selling of these foods, which might mess up the economy. Plus, steak and bacon are amazing. I agree! But we should eat those things from vegan based ingredients so we don't harm ourselves, non-human animals, or make people over-seas become even more impoverished. sources: https://www.rawfoods.com/history/ https://books.google.com/books?id=1GYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=VEGANISM+Evolutionary&source=bl&ots=eW_KK2I3Hj&sig=V7xFuGQ03ut6KZtoJmrHgYNjocQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHxtK3jIjKAhVFKMAKHVuICS4Q6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&q=VEGANISM%20Evolutionary&f=false https://www.veganhistory.org/becoming-raw/ https://www.scribd.com/doc/1359278/A-History-of-the-Raw-Food-Movement-in-the-United-States#fullscreen https://books.google.com/books?id=1GYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=VEGANISM+Evolutionary&source=bl&ots=eW_KK2I3Hj&sig=V7xFuGQ03ut6KZtoJmrHgYNjocQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHxtK3jIjKAhVFKMAKHVuICS4Q6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&q=VEGANISM%20Evolutionary&f=false https://books.google.com/books?id=1GYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=VEGANISM+Evolutionary&source=bl&ots=eW_KK2I3Hj&sig=V7xFuGQ03ut6KZtoJmrHgYNjocQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHxtK3jIjKAhVFKMAKHVuICS4Q6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&q=VEGANISM%20Evolutionary&f=false https://www.rawfoods.com/history/
70	Definitions: Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals http://en.wikipedia.org... product - something produced; especially : commodity 1 (2) : something (as a service) that is marketed or sold as a commodity http://www.merriam-webster.com... The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain’t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.
71	Honestly, you could be vegan I don't care if your, freedom right. I don't know if your trying to force veganism on people but if so that violation the first amendment. Claim: Veganism should be forced upon 99% of adult humans. Warrant: It is well known that fruits and vegetables are healthy. Vegan diets exclude many foods yet allow fruits in vegetables. Therefore, its only logical that most vegans will eat more fruits and vegetables thus being healthier. A multivitamin can take care of any nutrient deficiencies met on a vegan diet. Claim: Meat is wasteful compared to grain. Warrant: "Meat is less efficient because we eat the animal that eats the grain instead of eating the grain ourselves. It takes about 15 pounds of feed to make 1 pound of beef, 6 pounds of feed for 1 pound of pork and 5 pounds of feed for 1 pound of chicken, the Department of Agriculture estimates. For catfish, it's about 2 pounds of feed per pound of fish." [2]. Impact: A vegan diet takes less acreage compared to an omnivorous diet. Claim: World hunger exists today. Warrant: "The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 805 million people of the 7.3 billion people in the world, or one in nine, were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2012-2014." [3]. Impact: World hunger could be mitigated if more people decided to turn vegan. At least 99% of human adults should eat vegan in the entire world. Vote Pro. V.

72	Bacon and steak are not really bacon and steak without the meat that goes into them. Also, in many countries, including America, the majority of the population eat meat. While some might argue that facon tastes better than bacon, it can be agreed that it does not taste the same. Plus, getting rid of the meat industry entirely would be different than transitioning from milk to soy (more milk is sold than soy anyways). With no more meat being sold, animals like pigs would no longer be useful, and many of them might be slaughtered. To cause everyone to go vegan might in a way support the cause you are fighting against. Humans aren't the only ones who kill living beings, many animals like tigers, lions, and sharks eat living beings to survive. We do not force them to eat plants though! Why are humans supposed to defy the laws of nature and stop eating something that has been part of our diet since the beginning of the human race!
73	Lacto ovo vegetarian = hippopotamus: A lacto ovo vegetarian diet excludes meat, fish, and poultry but includes dairy products and eggs. So you say hippopotamus is lacto ovo vegetarian. Great! We have a place to start. Under your definition hippopotamus eat eggs, milk and cheese, but they are strictly vegan; they are just faking eating eggs and cheese to be cool. Hippopotamuses munch on grasses, water plants and such things. Yes, they sometimes bite on a person or alligator who get in their faces from time to time; but they do spit them out, just yucky. Did you know that a hippopotamus"s closest relative is whales and porpoises, who are not non-vegan? They will eat just about anything that moves. So much for cousins taking up the ethical family"s eating habits in an effort to save animal lives. Also, the word hippopotamus is from an ancient Greek word (strange alphabet that does not cut and paste) which means water horse. A horse is a vegan also; yeah! Hippopotamus are classified along with other two toed animals such as camels, cattle, deer and pigs. Camels and cattle are vegans, pigs not so much; non-vegans. But, camels are related to llamas and alpacas; cows have their cousin the bison, deer are related to elks and gazelles; all are vegan. Bonus points for this group. So there you have it, horses, camels, deer, cattle, bison, alpacas, llamas, elks, gazelles and hippopotamus are hippopotamus therefore, vegans pretending to be Lacto ovo vegetarians who care about ethics by not eating other animals. Whereas, whales, porpoises, and pigs are unethical meat eating non-vegan nasty folk, also known as carnivors. https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://www.dummies.com/…/vegetarian/lacto-ovo-vegetarian/
74	Meat eaters are not ignorant in my opinion. I am sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one. Being at least one of the things on the preceding list should disqualify ignorance as a reason for eating meat. Personally, I enjoy meat because of preference. I understand what happens on farms, factories, butcher shops, restaurants, etc with meat. More selfish? Well, what's selfish? Selfish seems to mean that one cares for one's self without any regards to others. I will agree that selfish is a proper word to use. Meat eaters take advantage of life on earth for personal gain and pleasure. However, we as humans are way past selfish all together. Anyone taking part in the industrial revolution and the results of it are selfish. We take advantage of earth and the things of it for our own personal gain or pleasure. We chop down trees, we dirty up water, we burn oil and coal, we dig and landscape every other acre of earth, we capture animals and genetically change them to be our fluffy pets instead of letting them roam free in the environment, we run over squirrels, and instead of eating food that grows from our surroundings, we destroy land that is already there, plant new plants that aren't natural to the area, and then they take the crops and turn them in to something more desired. Simply put, humans are selfish. We all do things that destroy the environment for our personal gain with little regards for the environment. So, we as humans are selfish and care less about others for our own personal reasons. If this debate is how vegans are better and smarter than meat eaters, than this debate is not a good idea. You and I (I'm assuming you're a vegan) are only different because of our eating choices. We are both, at the end of the day are selfish, less caring beings because we are humans. You have been destructive to the environment for pleasure and personal gain, just as I have. So, I am a more selfish, less caring person than you are because I have different eating choices? I don't think that is a fair, honest analysis of a fellow human being.
75	Thank you for your response. The argument I made about me being more selfish was meant to be taken on a very, very broad scale. If I do support the murder of fellow earthlings than yeah, I am selfish. BUT, and I'm not saying it's okay, but why do we draw the line at animals' living condition (current state of life)? Why don't we draw the line at destroying their habitats, using them for testing and using them for experiments? And if the line is drawn there as well, why is vegan the start of it all? Animals who are not meant to eat meat would probably reject it when ingested, however, humans, whom are animals, do not reject it (actually, on some scale, I do. I have IBS but... another story another time). I know this area of this popular debate was not mentioned, I just wanted to throw that out there. I hope it can be understood that I am running on zero sleep right now and I am not 100% focused, so what may seem off topic or weird is just me typing with one eye closed. but my turn is almost up and I shall fight through. Something I want to cover is this pleasure. We are selfish, and we are eating at another's expense, but if we enjoy it, it boosts our morale and mental health. Mental health is an important part of anyone's overall health. Now, it's wrong to seek this pleasure in the form of murder (I think murder is the incorrect word for this and I will explain why soon).   We are humans, and humans have the capacity to eat meat. Meat is justifiable. At this point, having had captured and farmed so many animals for so long, many farm animals have genetically changed over time to dependlargly on humans, making life hard for them if they were free. We as humans let them live a pretty good life before meeting it's end. My point is, it would take a lot of years to reverse what we have done, and it would also destroy the first world (and some lesser) economies. So many states in the United States and European States rely on having meat used. By the time we are able to stop and reverse our damage, humans will be on their way out of their turn on Earth.
76	Some of the more prim and proper women consider ingesting Harry Monk [1] to be a common, vulgar practice: unbecoming of a lady and, therefore, they refuse to imbibe such testicular tinctures. However, most women these days aren't so prudish and are quite happy to quaff their boyfriends' penile coloda. That said, some of these gunk-guzzling girls are vegans for ethical reasons and are, therefore, sworn to abstain from consuming animal products. This is an outrage because humans are a species of animal and sperm is produced by humans, so it is totally hypocritical of vegan women to swallow their sires' semen. Thank you. [1] https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=harry%20monk
77	I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's "semenal work". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is "seminal", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious. Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then "finish the job" by swallowing his muck will "remove antagonism" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. So, by choosing to swallow her sire's semen vegan women are deliberately breaking their vow not to consume animal products and are, therefore, hypocrites. [1] I expect. [2] Probably.
78	It's funny that such arguments would come from a person who only feeds their dog vegetables. You use the term "animals" as though all animals are omnivores. Of course, it is a well known fact that most animals are vegans. Take the mighty lion for example. It only eats fresh raw fruits and vegetables such as zebra and buffalo. Vegetables have all the vitamins and minerals that you've mentioned. Maybe B12 is lacking, but google "durianride" to find out about vegan B12 supplements. Most human beings, meat-eaters or not, have a B12 deficiency. Vegetables and fruits are also rich in nutrients that you can never find in meat... such as chicken and beef. You can only find chicken and beef in vegetables and fruits. Cheese is another example of an essential nutrient nowhere to be found in meat and dairy. How can you live a healthy life without cheese?
79	I'm in favour for nuclear energy. For economical reasons, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Like my opponent said, nuclear power plants are expensive to build and we need to use energy for building it. But the main mistake that we make is we are looking too close to this subject. Nuclear power plant is an energy source which can give us highly more energy then others. If we compare a nuclear power plant with thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy will gain us what we lost while we're building the centrals. And the ending of the fossil fuels are really close(1). We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy has many radioactive wastes. But I think that we can agree on something: The worlds most important problem is Global Warming. It will destroy us slowly. And that's why we're our children to be careful and be aware of the effects of global warming. Now whit this fabulous energy type, we have a chance to and the global warming. For the effects of nuclear power plants, I need you to know that 95% of the energy generated by nuclear burn up is without any waste of CO2. So we should use nuclear energy to stop our biggest problem in the world. For the risks, Nuclear radiation is risky but the radiation will leave the central only if there is a crack in the central. We had seen it in Chernobyl, but now, we have a better technology and better scientist. We need to trust on our people to make this energy useful. Secondly., radiation is an important factor but we can't prove that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course it will effect the human health but ,we, people experience a lot of technological devices in our daily lives, like phones or televisions. Are we going to get rid of them just because of radiation? And the cancers are highly caused because of portable telephones, especially(2). Radars, satellite stations and microwave ovens operate also high radio frequencies. 1:http://www.forbes.com... 2:http://www.cancer.gov...
80	There once was a saying that went something like this. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Clearly, this is not the case for neither my opponent, nor myself. The non-renewable bubbas are quick to dismiss anything positive, and exacerbate anything negative that would threaten their cash flow. Welcome to modified capitalosm. Voting issues: 1. There is no doubt that nuclear energy works. 2. Likewise, there is no doubt that there ae inherent dangers associated with nuclear, and we have yet to discover a feasible way to dispose of the toxic waste without further endangering lives and ecology. 3. Start up costs clearly make it prohibitive for much of the world. 4. As only a handful can afford it, nuclear constitutes only 16%. This deduces that 84% comes from alternative sources. I have demonstrated that the 3 headed renewable energies, wind, hydro, and solar, are indeed efficient, affordable, and cleaner than nuclear. I went on to make the audience further aware of the possibility of magnetic energy. While still in it's infancy, should magnetic energy blossom, everyone, everyone could benefit from this discovery. Yes it is a monetary threat to the Haliburtons of the world, yet they too could prosper by among the first to expand this invention. Conclusion. My opponent outlined the merits of nuclear energy and attempted to minimize the effects of it's toxic waste. I have demonstrated viable alternatives. I would like to thank my opponent Ore_Ele for a good discussion that if read widescale, it could open eyes at the highest levels of the people who make our decisions.
81	1. Those 3500 workers are employed for 20-30 years. Which takes up half a work-life. Therefore, although they are temporary, that is jobs created until they are halfway to retirement. My opponent states solar plants, which is a good source of energy, but he has forgotten that this is a debate about whether or not other forms are good, but instead that nuclear power is good.  2. Nuclear waste is the biggest con in the nuclear energy. This is going to be readily solved in 2 ways a. The space elevator is only 2-4 decades away (http://news.yahoo.com...) when a half life is 1 thousand years, that is acceptable. b. Fusion reactors are rapidly approaching, this doesn't just get rid of nuclear waste, but also creates more power.  3. The cost of a nuclear power benefits the economy even more and forgets the point of this argument.
82	I'm only 11 btw. And my sister is also against me. Well, Think about It, Which is worse use making waste and putting in a hole(nuclear) or pumping lots of bad stuff into the air(coal). Every single energy making way has a bad side to it, And I'm not saying that nuclear power is perfect. I think we should use nuclear energy more till we have an Eco-friendly way of making energy. There is a new material called thorium that becomes safe in only 100 years, And we as humans are looking into a way to reuse nuclear power, And by looking into: I mean we are building these generators. To solve the volcano problem we could put a waste facility in the middle of a tectonic plate. Even though there have been 7 explosives in the world, 3 of them have been contained and each explosive reaction has happened in a 30-year break. Scientist say that in 40 more years humans can produce energy in an eco-friendly way, So there will probably be only one more nuclear explosion, And witch tec expanding there might not even be a next explosive. For the 3 argument, You got me there. Even though the cost is on the rise, Tec has to improve and to improve we need more money. I know cost is going on the rise, But we probably won't keep using nuclear power for long. There one day will be an eco-friendly way of making electricity. Nuclear power is more efficient, 300 tonnes of Uranium equals 3500000 tonnes of coal. Also, Did you know that in 2013 NASA did research, And nuclear incident deaths are ranked dead last(including the nuclear explosions) for the most deaths. When we started using nuclear energy we so far have saved 240 gigatonnes of co2 from going into our air. Please, I would like to hear what else is bad about nuclear energy. (I'm doing a project about this topic).
83	Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been "sightings" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency upon nuclear energy there will be a growing need, This is not good because our storage places are limit right now. The cost of nuclear energy is on the rise, From 2002 to 2009 the cost per plant has raised by five to seven billion dollars. This is the cost to begin the construction of a nuclear power plant and doesn't take into consideration the cost of fuel, Maintenance and physical running cost, Let alone real estate and storage cost. The average cost to create a solar farm can be afford by your average upper middle-class American. This fact shows that there are cheaper forms of renewable energy that may not be as efficient, But are more reasonable for consumer and environment.
84	I will first defend my arguments and then attack what my opponent has said.  1) My opponent never really attacks my first contention about how this has worked in other countries so that still stands.  2) My opponent cites hurricane sandy and natural disasters saying that plants could be breached but the American power plants were not damaged. He also makes note of the disaster in Japan. (1) This was not because of a problem with Nuclear reactors but a problem in withholding high standards. These standards are getting met by the U.S.A. and no nuclear damage from sandy is proof.  3) If several stations are commissioned at once, then the cost should go down because of economies of scale - a sort of bulk discount. (2) Once built, nuclear power plants have advantages. In a gas-fired plant, the gas alone makes up 80% of the cost of electricity. So firms and consumers are very exposed to the wholesale price of gas.But at a nuclear power plant, the fuel is processed uranium, accounting for just 10% of the cost of production. While it may cost more to build it will be a good investment for the future.(3)  My opponent says that the exuberant cost is a huge deal. (2)(3) This shows that nuclear power is able to be built for much less than what he has stated. This also shows that once it is built it is far more effective. He states that there is a very large safety issue with nuclear energy.(sorry for the long chart)(4)  Coal " global average 170,000 (50% global electricity) Coal " China 280,000 (75% China"s electricity) Coal " U.S. 15,000 (44% U.S. electricity) Oil 36,000 (36% of energy, 8% of electricity) Natural Gas 4,000 (20% global electricity) Biofuel/Biomass 24,000 (21% global energy) Solar (rooftop) 440 (< 1% global electricity) Wind 150 (~ 1% global electricity) Hydro " global average 1,400 (15% global electricity) Nuclear " global average 90 (17% global electricity w/Chern&Fukush)  As shown by this chart nuclear energy s by far the most efficient in energy per life lost. If it has the most energy per life lost it is the safest. I also use this rebuttal vs the waste management as it is causing next to no damage. My opponent never says anything that could take over the role of nuclear besides more gas and when we already have to import almost half of our oil this is not the right step. I would also like to say that the BP oil spill has caused an extreme amount of damage. (5) America needs energy and the only option is nuclear. http://www.theaustralian.com.au... (2)But if several stations are commissioned at once, then the cost should go down because of economies of scale - a sort of bulk discount. (3)http://www.google.com... (4)http://www.forbes.com...

85	As already admitted, there are cons to nuclear, as there are cons to all sources. At least with nuclear we aren't destroying the atmosphere. And if you look at other countries, they seem to be handling things just fine. With regard to weapons, the USA already has hundreds of them. Using nuclear energy isn't going to add to that, or change that. We won't magically start using them. The con only argued that Chernobyl was a long time ago, and other countries are doing just fine with waste and disasters. My response to that is that while other countries have had nuclear accidents, they have been able to handle them safely and continue using nuclear energy.
86	In this round, my opponent again misunderstood and misinterpreted my arguments either deliberately or accidentally. He claims that solar technology is unproven, despite the fact it has been proven for years. He claims recent developments in solar technology are unknown, despite the fact they have been proven several times. He claims that we need nuclear energy NOW, and that using alternative forms of energy should come later as they take too much time, despite nuclear reactors taking much longer to set up than solar power plants. He also brings up that nuclear waste is stored in the desert, so it can't reach our water supply, despite the fact most nuclear power plants are on the East coast, where no such desert to seclude the radioactive waste exists. In conclusion, with every point of my opponent's argument refuted, the United States should clearly NOT substantially increase nuclear energy. With your vote obliged to go to CON, I thank you for reading and bid you good day.
87	First, I'd like to apologize for forgetting to provide citations in Round 2. However, I believe the arguments I made still stand. Carbon is released in earlier stages of nuclear energy production, as I mentioned in my Round 2, and this is a problem. Additionally, look to my Round 2, where I showed Radon, Krypton, and other gases released that have led to thyroids being removed in Belarus. My opponent must disprove these examples: Same amount of Carbon emissions by 2050, Noble Gasses, and Carbon released in early stages. Noble Gasses and Carbon released in early stages disproves all the early facts brought up. Efficiency is a problem with nuclear energy because it creates 20% of energy, which is a 0% increase. Also, the cleanliness is incorrect. Nuclear Energy can only create 20% of energy due to increasing demand, thus meeting ZERO percent.
88	Sorry, I've been cruising around in the Caribbean for the past week. I thought I'd have internet, but I didn't. So this'll just have to become a 2-round debate. You're definitely right that coal and oil aren't going to serve us much longer. We're fast reaching the end of the earth's supply of oil. Soon we're going to have to find a different, renewable source of energy to keep us alive and driving our cars. But I don't think the predominant one will be wind energy. Ever notice that the only places that really utilize wind for electricity are small, rural villages? The reason is simple: wind energy just isn't powerful enough. Huge fields of windmills are only enough to power small towns. How many windmills do you think it would take to power a metropolis like New York? I'm not sure what will top out as the best new energy source when oil hits the can, but I think it will probably be nuclear, at least until we run out of fuel for that too. Nuclear reactions create a HUGE amount of power, and if we ever figure out how to make a sustained fusion reaction, we'll have an endless supply of very powerful fuel. >Wind energy is the best available energy because it will never run out. Neither will solar, hydro, geothermal, etc. >All other energy's will either run out or are way to expensive to start up and keep running. Not really. It might not be too expensive to make a few hundred windmills for a rural village, but the costs of building and maintaining enough windmills to sustain the whole world (we're talking millions and millions) would be a lot. On the other hand, for example, it is very cheap to put a power plant in a dam or waterfall capable of powering a small city. >Some other energy's are bad for the environment and will make the world a worse place than it is and will be with using fossil fuels. I'm assuming you're referring chiefly to nuclear, which has seen a few unfortunate disasters. But nuclear energy is only dangerous when power plants are poorly maintained or some nutjob throws radioactive isotopes into the ocean. Today's federal regulations make another disaster like Three Mile Island extremely unlikely. >Also, some people are too busy with work and handling kids that they don't have time to try to make a difference in the world and change what energy sources we are using most frequently. Not me. I'm soon going into mechanical engineering, and am strongly considering heading into the field of alternate energy for a career. It really is a promising field. It's good to see that some other people are looking into this subject.
89	Who is this man "Trump." There have been several articles posted on the internet lately that suggest that Donald Trump isn't who he is portraying himself to be, as a conservative republican. In a REDSTATE ARTICLE for instance the author of the article states,"The Bible says not to put new Christians in leadership positions. I don't think the conservative movement should put new conservatives in leadership positions either. Let them be sure what they believe first." In the same article its stated that Donald Trump has been a contributor to the democrat party and organizations that conservatives were against so that certainly raises the question about who Donald trump reallty is   Some have suggested that Donald trump is a spoiler taking away votes that could have gone to another republican candidate running for president who is a more known conservative ruining the republicans chances of winning the White House. Donald Trump covers himself by saying that he was a businessman and as such, he gave money to a lot of different causes and people, that was the way business was done.  Isn't the reason that Donald Trump is gaining so much support is because the conservatives and republicans in general are becoming fed up with the way the "Good old boys," "/ Establishment republicans, and establishment democrats, have been doing business as usual in Washington.  Betting on Donald Trump to be the conservatives and independents friend is a gamble, only time will tell whether the gamble paid off, if Donald trump actually believed in what he said that he believed in.  Donald Trump is saying what conservatives and independents wanted to hear, but is it a businessman just doing business and saying what he thinks will sell, again, only time will provide the answer, we can only hope that Donald Trump doesn't turn out to be a spoiler and allow Hillary or some other democrat to be elected to office.  The conservative and independents are tired of being lied to , we can only hope that Donald Trump isn't just mouthing the words that the conservatives and independents wanted to hear and actually meant what he's been saying.
90	Thank you for posting your debate blackhawkbunny34. No Donald Trump? What happens when Donald Trump loses his touch? I've done some research and found that Donald Trump has some unstable qualities. He declared himself god in his last debate. Also, what have Iraq and Syria done to us? WHY do you we need to blow them off the face of the Earth? That could start a world war that would end very badly. It's our government's job, also, to help people looking for a better life coming to the states. In closing, we as a union should not vote for Donald Trump. It will end badly.
91	Donald Trump would be a bad candidate. He has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and doesn't explain things at all! He said he will replace Obamacare with "something terrific", like what? When he says terrific, it may mean horrible! He doesn't explain how it will be! China is one of the United State's major trade partners, and Donald Trump's stance on trading with China? "Listen you motherf*cker, we're going to tax you 25 percent!" China is a very important country to the US, and China would be outraged if Donald Trump actually follows through. Here is another quote from Donald Trump. "I will build a great wall " and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me " and I"ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words." How will he make Mexico pay for that wall? Mexican President Vicente Fox said multiple times "he would not pay for that f---ing wall." Mexico is our 3rd biggest trade partner, and over 2 million people's jobs are related to trade with Mexico. Trying to get Mexico to pay for the wall would put 2 million jobs at risk. Donald Trump doesn't really have a plan for that(or anything)! If you take a look at the Republicans' political experience, Donald Trump is one of the few that has none. Cruz, Rubio, and even most of the other long-shot candidates have some sort of political background. That's why Donald trump would be an inexperienced and bad candidate. And, Donald Trump is both racist and sexist. He thinks all Mexicans are rapists, is a friend of Ku Klux Klan, and called women fat, pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals, and so on. In 2007, he compared women to architecture. He also called all women gold-diggers. He made many more sexist and insulting comments to women, and also many racist comments about Mexicans. There is a Donald Trump sexism tracker. Here is the link: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ This is proof that Donald Trump would be the worst president if he wins, worse than any other president in history.

93	I will start off with some definitions. Definitions Kratocratic- government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning. Sith- ancient kratocratic organization wielding the dark side of the Force, typically using crimson lightsabers and attempting to achieve great power. Arguments Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power- One of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruction. Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government. Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power. Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist. Donald Trump's asinine claims about Mexican criminals being "rapists" and "murderers" are akin to the Sith's attempts to criminalize the Jedi near the fall of the Old Republic. Donald Trump wears Sith garments and command a legion of soldiers- Donald Trump has been observed wearing traditional Sith cloaks, and has been seen commanding armies of Stormtroopers. This guarantees his connection with the Dark Side. [1][2] Sources https://i.imgur.com/IVBVRzH;[1] https://i.imgur.com/mF61UFH
94	Dear The Conservative Socialist,   Donald Trump is racist because he believes that blacks are lazy and he is a liar because he thinks he is the "least racist person". He also teases Native Americans too. He once saw 1 or 2 Native Americans and said "They don't look like Indians to me. They don't look like Indians to Indians!" He thinks white supremacists are heroes. Who knows? He might want to kill our current President of the United States: Barack Hussein Obama.   You know voting for him is a terrible idea, and unless you want Donald J Trump turn the land of the free and the home of the brave, from sea to shining sea, support me so we can stand against him!    Thank You,   Drago 31
95	qwzx has accepted this debate with knowledge that this results in automatic loss, as dictated by rule 6. However, he's trying to argue his case that I was not specific enough on what exactly you will lose. Any person with common sense would be able to know that I meant he would lose the debate by accepting. However, I ALSO did not specify which Trump I meant, so my mistake. The only reason I didn't put in his middle name is that Donald Jackleberry Trump is an imaginary character.
96	Although I do agree with your stance on Donald Trump's economic benefits, he has no sense of humanity. A POTUS must have the ability to connect and relate to the people of The United States of America, regardless of age, race, gender, or ability. The fact that Trump has already caused protests, including the organization of the Women's March, further proves that he is far too incompetent to run the largest economic country in the world. Furthermore, the POTUS must act as a role model for all citizens, whether it is part of the job description or not. Trump may be a business mogul, but he will never be a fair and true President.
97	Sadly...The American Dream... IS DEAD" It isn't! Not yet... but if he wins... it will be!. Hillary Clinton called Trump a racist and Trump responded: "Failing candidate Hillary Clinton, who is desperately trying to hold on to her lead in the democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, is knowingly putting out lies about my stance on illegal immigration. I said "Mexico is sending"" I"m not knocking immigration or immigrants, but rather am very critical of the country of Mexico for sending us people that they don"t want. Likewise I am very critical of illegal immigration and the tremendous problems including crime, which it causes. She is desperate, she is sad, and she is obviously very nervous when she has to revert to issues that have already been settled given the absolute accuracy of my statement. She speaks about "my tone" and that"s the problem with our country"s leaders. They are more worried about tone than results! It's not about being nice" it's about being competent. Hillary should spend more time producing her illegally hidden emails and less time trying to obfuscate a statement by me that is totally clear and obviously very much accepted by the public as true. I am honored, however, that she is attacking me, instead of Jeb Bush. Obviously she knows that JEB is no longer her real competition. The last person she wants to face is Donald Trump." He lied about Hillary being a sad excuse for a candidate. He lies unintentionally and finds it hard to stop. I know what you're thinking: "I need evidence!" This is a part of an article I found on a website: Donald Trump is a serial liar. Okay, to be a bit less Trumpian about it, he has trouble with the truth. If you look at Politifact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning site that examines candidates" pronouncements for accuracy, 76 percent of Trump"s statements are rated either "mostly false," "false," or "pants on fire," which is to say off-the-charts false. By comparison, Hillary Clinton's total is 29 percent.
98	I think if Donald Trump doesn't win the election, the Democrats aren't going to have any work to do. They always find fault and not helping people. I don't like his ways, but must say he is the only president that is actually telling the truth. And yet, nobody is paying attention to what he is saying. Guess we rather be lied to. If I was him, I would give over the presidency now and let the Democrats sort out the mess they have made. The virus is only making the rich richer, there is no such thing as global warming. So, who is really making money out of this? The Democrats and the rest of the world have put us into poverty. And yet, we don't pay attention to someone that is trying to restart. I saw Robert De Niro making comments against Donald Trump and yet, the idiot wants to make a movie on the virus. Who is more evil?
