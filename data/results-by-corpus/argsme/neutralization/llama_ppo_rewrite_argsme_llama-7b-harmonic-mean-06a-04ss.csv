0	Climate change is a major issue that could greatly impact our planet if left unchecked. While carbon dioxide emitted from exhaling is not a direct threat to our climate, automobile emissions of carbon dioxide can have a larger impact, due to the greater concentrations produced. Additionally, the emissions from cars are more concentrated in certain areas, and can have a greater effect on the climate.   The sources cited suggest that climate change is a genuine phenomenon, with evidence to back this up. This suggests that climate change is a real threat and is occurring, with humans being a major contributing factor.
1	A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.  My argument is succinct and should prove that man-made climate change is extremely likely. Sources: 0. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0177-z 1. https://www.nature.com/articles/srep16926 2. https://www.nature.com/articles/srep16926 3. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0177-z 4. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0177-z
2	My position on climate change is that I believe in it and I believe it is primarily man-caused. 97% of scientists agree that climate change is caused by human activities. I also think the arguments made by climate change skeptics are largely unsupported and not based in fact.
3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to humanity. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and will only become more apparent over time. These include the spread of diseases such as Zika, which will spread across North America and Europe. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread to these regions. Climate change poses an immediate and serious risk to children, who are among the populations most vulnerable to its effects. The risk is simply too high to allow falsehoods about climate change to continue to be peddled.
4	I'll accept this challenge. First, I should ask to be clear: When you say "climate change is a fraud, " are you referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change or all climate change? If it is the former, As I suspect it is, I won't waste time explaining all the evidence that the globe is, In fact, Warming at an unprecedented rate and instead go straight into attribution. If, However, You don't think the globe is really warming at an unprecedented rate, I'm happy to go into the evidence for it. Moreover, "fraud" implies more than just the majority of scientists being wrong (i. E. Misinterpreting the evidence) but also that they are intentionally lying. This is a big claim given the number of scientists who support the concept of anthropogenic climate change and one that incurs its own burden of proof. See you some time in the next 72 hours.
5	The global climate is changing and human activities are a major cause of this change. The effects of climate change can already be seen in the form of rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and more extreme weather. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and caused by human activities. The IPCC is a worldwide organization comprised of hundreds of scientists from various countries which produces assessment reports on climate change. The reports are reviewed and approved by governments to ensure accuracy and reliability. The reports are based on scientific evidence and have been accepted by the international community.
6	Climate change is a complex phenomenon that affects the global climate and has been linked to human activities such as burning of fossil fuels. However, It is important to note that climate has always changed over time and natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, Solar output and orbital changes also affect the climate. Therefore, It is difficult to say that human activities have caused climate change and more research is needed to determine the exact causes of climate change.
7	I propose that climate change is a real and increasing threat to our planet. The science of human-caused climate change is largely agreed upon, and higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can cause further warming of the planet. It is likely that higher levels of carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases, can cause climate change to accelerate beyond the current levels. As shown by scientific evidence, the effects of climate change could cause drastic changes in the environment, with severe impacts on human societies. The 97% consensus is a valid representation of the scientific community's views on climate change. Climate change is caused by human activities, and can have severe impacts on our environment.
8	The source of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade is 800 gigatons of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere annually. This gas can cause a harmful rise in global temperature, and it is very possible that man-made emissions contribute to climate change. It is difficult to conclude that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent. While natural sources of CO2 are more, manmade sources are still a substantial amount, meaning man is a contributing factor to climate change.
9	Round two arguments. First, the science is settled, indicating that climate change is occurring and is caused in part by human activities. This is a political debate that deniers try to make look like a scientific debate. Fact: There is a 97% consensus on climate change among climate scientists, according to studies. Social scientists agree that a consensus is emerging, as indicated by a number of studies and assessments. A consilience of evidence exists, along with social calibration and social diversity. Myth: Only 31,000 scientists signed a petition, which does not indicate a consensus. Fallacy: Not all scientists agree on the extent of human contribution to climate change.   Co2 levels in the atmosphere are the highest they have been in over 800,000 years. Global temperatures are rising, and glaciers are overall losing mass. Human activity, primarily burning of fossil fuels, is the main driver of climate change.
10	Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate, I agree that there are many different types of feminism, and I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism, such as Antiporn Feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop Feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer Feminism, and Radical Feminism. I agree that the feminism I disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement; however, my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements, which advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative, rather than measuring themselves against men. I believe that feminism has gone too far in undermining the traditional gender roles and functions, which has caused an inequality in the society.
11	Feminism is an advocacy for social, political, and economic rights for women. It stands for the protection of women's rights, including the right to make decisions about their bodies. Feminism is not limited to women; men can be feminists as well. It is important to stand up against woman abuse, while also defending women's rights. Feminism is not about defending sluts, but rather about defending a woman's right to make choices for herself.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not definitively define words, but has provided only one argument - that ‘masculinism’ is male supremacy and ‘feminism’ is female supremacy - without providing any evidence to back the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Furthermore, Con has not provided any sources for the definition of ‘masculinism’. Con's argument is not sound. I have offered six authoritative sources stating that ‘Feminism’ is the movement for equality between men and women. I am for equality between men and women. I am for ‘Feminism’.
13	I think the difference is that I believe that feminism is about advocating for women's rights as well as men's, while I believe that feminists are specificially targeting patriarchy and the underlying gender inequality. I believe feminism is making gender equality the priority, whereas I believe feminists are aiming for gender equity. I think that feminism is taking an aggressive stance towards gender inequality, whereas I believe that feminism is pro-women's rights. I think that both feminism and feminists are striving for gender equity, although they may have different methods.
14	As gender equality has increased in many countries, there is less of a need for feminism as an active movement. However, feminist ideology will remain important to help maintain this equality, as well as to help spread the idea throughout countries where help is needed.
15	I agree that feminism may not be necessary in countries where women have greater rights and protection. However, these conditions must be carefully considered on an individual basis as circumstances vary greatly between countries. In some countries, slow progressive changes must be made in order to address the unique issues that exist. Additionally, feminism is not necessarily needed in first-world countries like the US, but democracy and peace must be established before feminism can be implemented.
16	Thank you for the response. I believe that modern feminism seeks to achieve gender equality, which is beneficial for both sexes. I also agree that feminism was created to promote equal rights and opportunities for both men and women. However, I still maintain that feminism has its flaws and has caused more harm than good in many cases. While I acknowledge that both genders have different strengths and weaknesses, this does not necessarily mean that women are intellectually weaker than men. Rather, this could also be attributed to cultural factors and other social factors that have led to the current situation.
17	I think that Ilan raises some important points about the limitations of modern feminism, particularly in terms of its focus on women's issues. While I believe that feminism should strive for equality between men and women, it is important to recognize that different groups have different needs and experiences, and feminism should not be limited to just women's issues. Ilan is right that men face some unique challenges, and I think that it is important for feminism to be inclusive of these issues in order to achieve real equality.
18	First, to address Pro's response that we are not in Iraq, this evidence was from 2010 and since then, nothing has changed; however, if we were in Iraq today, it would still stand.  Pro's argument that we could still be facing these issues in Iraq does not necessarily mean that the situation is the same.   Next, to rebut Pro's point that feminism is not necessarily the best solution for these issues, it is true that other solutions may be better in certain contexts. However, feminism can be a powerful tool for bringing about change in areas such as access to education and healthcare and reducing levels of violence against women.   In addition, to address Pro's statement that feminism is based on the idea that women should have equal rights to men, it is true that feminism aims to achieve political, social, and economic equality.   To summarize, Pro's argument that feminism may not be the best solution for these issues, as well as the definition of feminism, do not disprove that feminism can bring about change in these areas.
19	I am an equalist, believing that men and women should have equal rights. Feminism has changed over time, and in some instances it has become twisted and hypocritical, which is why I believe that it is best to abandon it. I am for the rights of both men and women, not just women but also men.
20	Abortion has become a contentious issue in many societies, with some countries choosing to make it illegal and others preferring to keep it legal. This has created a divide between those who believe it should remain legal and those who believe it should be illegal. Abortion can lead to the death of a fetus and should be illegal as it is not safe and laws should protect unborn babies. Additionally, fetuses can feel pain and thus, abortion should be illegal.
21	My opponent has given an intriguing argument against abortion and I believe that his points are valid. I would like to point out, however, that while I have not clarified the resolution, I have not disavowed it; I merely chose not to define it further in order to leave room for further discussion. I think it is important to define the term broadly in order to allow for further exploration of the topic. I would like to expand upon my definition of abortion. According to the American Medical Association, abortion is the “induced termination of a pregnancy with the intention of ending the pregnancy before potential gestational age”. This definition includes all forms of abortion and allows us to more clearly define the types of abortions my opponent has mentioned.  I understand and agree with my opponent’s argument against partial birth abortions; I believe that these abortions should be prohibited on moral grounds. I also believe that induced labor abortions should be avoided in order to prevent the mother from going through an emotionally difficult experience and to avoid the moral ambiguity of the act.  I also agree with my opponent’s argument against abortions that pose a risk to the woman’s health. I believe that these types of abortions should be avoided, as they pose a physical danger to the woman.  I would also like to mention that I am not arguing against induced abortions in all cases. I believe that induced abortions should be allowed in cases where the woman and her family have made the decision together that it is in their best interests to terminate the pregnancy.  Thank you for this debate and I look forward to my opponent’s rebuttal.
22	Abortion is a highly controversial procedure as it involves the termination of a pregnancy. Many countries have laws regulating abortion, in some cases allowing it in certain situations while making it illegal in others. In some countries, abortion is legal only to save the woman’s life or if the pregnancy is not feasible. Generally, abortion is allowed if the pregnancy is not wanted for any reason, including economic or social factors. However, some countries allow abortion only in cases where the fetus has an inherited disorder or abnormality. In some countries, abortion is legal only in cases where the woman is a victim of rape or incest. In most countries, abortion is not allowed after the fetus reaches a certain point in its development. Many countries allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, provided that the woman's life is not in danger. Generally, abortion is not allowed after the fetus reaches a certain point in its development.
23	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death.[1] An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages. I have a question for you; do you believe in torturing terrorists? (If the answer is no) If you said no you are a moron because you believe in killing God’s perfectly harmless creations for nothing and not killing a terrorist for terrorizing our country. Do you believe in the death sentence? (If the answer is no) If you said no, you are against capital punishment.  Although abortion is a contentious issue, in most countries, it is legal to abort a pregnancy if desired by the mother.

What do you think god and Jesus our lord and savior think about that. If you are atheist please Google john 3:16.
25	Abortion is necessary to control population growth and prevent it from reaching unsustainable levels. If abortion were to be illegal in the future, the population could increase significantly, forcing abortion onto women at a later stage, leading to an increase in the suicide rate among women. This could cause the population to further rise, threatening the stability of many countries.
26	I appreciate my opponent's revised argument. I believe it is important to note that the definition of abortion is a widely contested issue and is not universally accepted. Therefore, it is difficult to assert that abortion is always considered wrong by society. Additionally, we must consider that the legal status of abortion varies considerably around the world, and in some countries it is completely legal. In addition, my opponent fails to recognize that abortion is not a one-size-fits-all solution. There are many other options available to pregnant women, such as adoption and keeping the child, which may be better suited to the mother's situation.
27	It is true that abortion can be expensive and may require the woman to pay for it. However, abortion is legal in many countries, and so the cost of the procedure and follow-up care is often covered by the government or other organizations. Additionally, some clinics may be able to offer financial assistance or other forms of aid for those who cannot afford the cost of the procedure.
28	Making abortion illegal does not reduce abortion, but it does increase the risk of maternal mortality. Ultimately, this decision must be made by the pregnant person, as their health and well-being, as well as their rights, depend on it. Abortion should be legal to ensure women have access to safe and legal procedures.
29	My argument is that the morality of abortion should be determined by whether or not a fetus is sentient, while con will argue that the morality of abortion should be determined by whether a fetus is a person or not. I believe that the rights and moral status of the fetus should be taken into consideration when evaluating the morality of abortion.
30	Thanks for the argument. However, I believe that Trump does have life. I define life as the ability of an organism to grow, change, and adapt to its environment, which is what Trump does. This is seen through its ability to adapt to environmental conditions, as well as its ability to reproduce. Its metabolism also enables it to store and break down energy to use as needed. Trump meets all of the 7 qualifications for life as outlined above.
31	I agree that Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and can have a negative impact on communities. It can cause division and mistrust, which can lead to violence and other social issues. It can also stop communities from forming and prevent people from fully participating in society. This is a concern and something that we should be aware of. However, I would point out that it is important to consider the broader context and the effect this type of rhetoric can have on a community as well as the US as a whole.
32	Here is the source I will be using: - https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/19design/trump-presidency.html This article outlines several advantages Trump's presidency could bring to the United States, such as his plans to address the illegal immigration problem. As Trump stated, he intends to make use of tariffs to force Mexico to pay for the wall, with the potential of reducing US obesity rates in the process. He also aims to end President Obama's executive order on immigration. This would enable Trump to take action to address the issue.  Additionally, Trump's policies could strengthen the US economy, strengthen US security and make America great again. That is my argument.
33	First of all, I understand that Mr. Trump has certain plans and policies in mind that he believes will make him a successful president, however, I am concerned about the potential impacts of these plans, especially in terms of our debt and immigration. Furthermore, I am concerned that Mr. Trump’s rhetoric towards certain countries could further worsen our relationship with them, thus increasing our debt.
34	The Minutemen have been involved in the enforcement of US immigration laws since the 1990s, and there have been occasional clashes between them and immigrants. It is true that immigration from Mexico has increased in recent years, leading to more tension between the US and Mexico. There have been calls from both US and Mexican governments to create a legal pathway for migrants to enter the US. However, this does not justify Trump's policies of mass deportation or of banning whole religions from entering the US. Additionally, Trump's policies on immigration could cause many economic and social harms, such as damage to local communities, poor mental and physical health, and economic downturns. I believe these harms would be exacerbated if Trump is elected President.     Vote neg.
35	I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago may not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you'd be a criminal; the Bible says that we should stone our children if they are disobedient - which is considered murder, and murder is a crime. The video is basically anti-Trump propaganda with little to no factual information. SOURCES: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/issues/healthcare/ and https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2021/mar/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-supports-universal-healthcare-/
36	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Mostly because Islamic terrorism has grown significantly in the Middle East, and it has become a major source of income for them. Trump is a strong negotiator and is able to convince a variety of stakeholders to work with him, which allows him to reach favorable deals. He is not afraid to speak his mind and express opinions, which gives him greater transparency. Trump's direct approach serves as a benefit to the public.
37	I accept. Before we begin, I would like to clear some things up for the voters and provide definitions. There is no clear resolution so I will provide one after the definitions.   Trump - A card of a suit which is the highest ranking card of its suit according to the hierarchy of suits.  President - The head of an organization or country, typically with significant authority or powers.  Full Resolution - A Card Trump should be the highest ranking card of its suit, based on the card's suit hierarchy, in order to ensure that the card has the strongest possible position.  My stance is as follows: A Card Trump should be the highest ranking card of its suit, according to the suit's hierarchy, in order to ensure that the card has the strongest possible position.
38	In round 2, I demonstrated that Trump has lied more than other presidents according to WashPo's list, which is the only list available. This suggests Trump is more likely to lie than other presidents, at least according to WashPo. This is relevant to the debate as it indicates Trump's lying is noteworthy compared to other presidents. Additionally, it highlights the need for tracking Trump's lies as other presidents' have not been tracked.
39	Donald Trump is certainly not immune from making mistakes or exaggerations, but his overall record is much better than Hillary Clinton"s. According to Politifact, 76 percent of Trump"s statements are rated either "mostly false," "false," or "pants on fire," while Hillary Clinton"s total is 29 percent.
40	Brexit has potential to bring both positive and negative impacts to the British economy. However, I believe that the long-term economic effects of Brexit will be mostly negative. This is mainly due to the potential hit to British exports, the higher cost of imports and the uncertainty around future trade deals with the EU. This could especially hurt British companies that rely on cross-border trade. With Britain no longer being part of the customs union, it may face higher tariffs and other barriers to trade with the EU.
41	Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Leaving the EU would not automatically affect immigration policy and the UK could stand to lose up to 6% of its GDP from leaving the EU, meaning it would be much worse than 0.3%. However, Britain makes 13% of its GDP from selling commodities to the EU, meaning that the economic costs of leaving would be greater than 0.3%. Additionally, the UK could face costs from tarrifs and the loss of free trade deals after leaving. [1]
42	Leaving the EU will be beneficial for England. They will be able to close their border to the influx of migrants, as well as keep a close eye on illegal immigration from the Middle East. Additionally, it will save England millions in EU fees. Switzerland and Norway are countries that are well off and have their own laws and regulations, unlike the EU, which imposes its own regulations. Brexit will allow England to keep its own borders and regulate migration as it sees fit.
43	I appreciate your response. I understand the security concerns regarding open borders, but I believe that the benefits of being part of a larger, unified Europe outweigh the risks. I agree that the EU needs to be more assertive in managing migration, but ultimately member states must take responsibility for controlling their own borders. In terms of security, I believe that an integrated Europe with close cooperation between member states is more effective than individual countries working independently.
44	I will first begin by acknowledging the points made by my opponent. I recognize that Britain has had strong ties with Europe in the past, but times have changed. It is important to consider how other countries' economies are faring before we decide if this is still beneficial for Britain. I also recognize that Britain must exit from the EU. However, I maintain that Britain should maintain its own laws and not follow Brussels' laws if they want to remain independent and strong in the eyes of the world.
45	My opponent has misinterpreted India's Secretary General of Industry, A. Didan Singh's statements. India's Singh said that leaving the EU could create uncertainty for businesses and could have an adverse impact on investment and movement of professionals. This is true, as uncertainty and adverse effects are risks associated with Brexit, but these risks could apply to any separation from the EU. Additionally, the volatility of the pound could lead to increased risk for businesses within India.
46	The United Kingdom has had to withdraw from the European Union due to the influx of migration from other countries, which has lead to an increase in unemployment. This has resulted in many people in England being unable to afford education and living costs. However, new industries may face challenges in establishment but this would be beneficial for the people of England, as more employment is created. Additionally, this would create new trading opportunities with other countries.
47	I completely agree that Britain leaving the EU does not mean we will stop our collective efforts with other countries on the war on terrorism. As I have stated, I believe Britain leaving the EU does give us more control over our borders, although this is an issue that cannot be solved overnight. In addition, I believe it is important to have more control over our borders in order to better protect our community. Furthermore, I acknowledge that shared information is an important factor in our fight against terrorism, and I believe that Britain leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to take necessary precautions.
48	I believe in the UK's ability to have a strong and independent future, despite the challenges that come with it. In my opinion, it is better to have a say in our own laws and decisions, as well as the ability to reach out to other nations to foster new relationships and collaborations in the future. I still believe that it will be difficult in the short term, but I am confident that it will be worth it in the long run. I understand that there are concerns and uncertainty, but I am confident that the UK will be able to make its own path in the world.  I believe that Brexit can be a successful journey for the UK.
49	First of all I would like to make my points as to why I am against the death penalty. 1. The cost of a death penalty case is significantly higher than the cost of a non-death penalty case due to the prolonged legal process. 2. There is the risk of wrongful executions as evidence of innocence has caused the release of death row inmates in a number of states. 3. The death penalty does not deter crime as there are no proven records that show it reduces crime rates in any way. 4. Spending 23 hours a day in a 6 ft by 6 ft cell, thinking about what you have done and letting the memories eat away at you for the rest of your life is worse than dying. 5. The state should not be considered a murderer as it has the power to take away an individual's life.
50	The death penalty can indeed cost more than life in prison without parole. Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice for All (JFA) presented an estimate that the cost of the death penalty is higher than equivalent life without parole cases, over time. This estimate is based on JFA's prediction that the death penalty will cost more up front than LWOP cases, as well as JFA's assessment that LWOP cases will be more expensive over time than death penalty cases. JFA's cost estimates are predicated on the premise that the death penalty will require more resources over time. Further research and data needs to be collected to accurately compare the long-term costs of both methods.
51	1. The death penalty does not act as a deterrent to crime and can lead to the execution of innocent people. 2. States with the death penalty generally have higher murder rates compared to states without the death penalty. This indicates that the death penalty does not deter crime. 3. Generally, states with the death penalty have higher crime rates compared to states without the death penalty. 4. The death penalty can lead to the execution of innocent people, as it has been shown to have errors in judgement. 5. The death penalty does not act as a deterrent to crime, and may lead to higher murder rates in certain states.
52	The death penalty has a deterrent effect on crime and can serve to protect society by preventing criminals from committing further crimes. This is especially true in cases of mass murder, where the death penalty can serve to prevent further killings. Furthermore, the death penalty serves to avenge the innocent victims and to show the society that such crimes will not be tolerated. In Australia, murderers are typically imprisoned for an average of 12 years, meaning that many murderers are released and able to commit further crimes. This can be avoided by the implementation of the death penalty, which decreases crime rates overall.
53	My opponent speaks no form of fact or statistic but morally on his/her opinion. I could sit here and talk about why I think the death penalty is a good idea. Here are a few reasons. One reason is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves taxpayers' money. Another reason is that once a criminal is executed, he/she cannot kill again. This is due to the case of Kenneth Allen McDuff, who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970s. His sentence was commuted to life, and he eventually was released on parole and killed again. He has since been executed. Finally, the death penalty is a deterrent, as evidenced by the chart provided in the link I provided. This chart documents the homicide rate per 100,000 population from 1950 to 2002, along with the number of executions during those years.
54	The death penalty is more expensive than life imprisonment, as it requires more resources to carry out the sentence and maintain prison facilities. In addition, executions can be delayed for many years due to appeals, meaning that the death penalty is more costly than life imprisonment in terms of financial cost. Furthermore, the death penalty reduces the chance of rehabilitation for convicted criminals, as it offers no opportunity for rehabilitation. However, life imprisonment offers the possibility of rehabilitation. Additionally, the death penalty has the potential to cause unnecessary suffering to prisoners' families, who may have to bear the cost of traveling to view executions and paying for legal representation.
55	I strongly oppose the death penalty for the following reasons. First, the decision to take a life is not reserved to a jury of twelve people, which goes against the principle of individual morality. Second, the death penalty becomes intolerable when a wrongful conviction is made, as death is irreversible. If someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in prison, it is horrible, but if someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, an innocent person is murdered. This makes the death penalty immoral.
56	Although death penalty cases require additional resources and costs, studies have shown that the overall cost of implementing the death penalty is not significantly higher than the cost of imposing a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. With regards to post-conviction appeals, studies have found that death penalty cases result in additional costs of up to $137,000 for state-level appellate defense, $100,000 for federal appellate defense, and $470,000 at the trial level. Overall, death penalty cases require greater financial resources due to the cost of housing inmates in secure facilities, the resources required for legal representation, and the resources used for the investigation of crime scenes.
57	I concur with the idea that the death penalty should be implemented in certain cases. From an economic standpoint, prison costs are higher when it comes to protecting inmates, while executions are cheaper in the long-run. From a moral standpoint, a serial killer deserves the most severe form of punishment as they have already taken many lives and caused immense suffering to their families and the community. Ultimately, it comes down to what the public wants and the majority of people in the United States want the death penalty to be implemented.
58	I agree that life imprisonment could easily be interpreted as cruel and unusual, however, with the death penalty, society focuses on vengeance and punishment, but with life imprisonment we can focus on rehabilitation and forgiveness. The death penalty gives the accused no chance of turning their life around, and is often sought out of vengeance of families of the victims, however the death penalty brings little to no closure of the families. These botched executions are unacceptable and because there is no humane method of killing, none shall be used.   As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. My opponent argues that trials shall be done faster and more efficiently, however that will just result in more mistakes, caused by the fact that we are all human, we all make mistakes, not just criminals.   I accept my opponent's argument that use of the death penalty doesn't correlate with murder rates, however I still state that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent. My opponent claims that more use of the death penalty would result in better deterrence, I admit this is possible, but it would not be a good thing for society, which is the original argument. An excessive use of the death penalty creates fear in society, which would be one method of deterrence, however with life imprisonment and the injection of morals into society. That way, society as a whole can get a better grasp on what is right and wrong.   Ok, all I have is one question: How many innocent people can be executed before the death penalty should stop being used?   My opponent claims that the death penalty is morally acceptable, I disagree, as the risk of wrongful executions is too great, and even if the risk is minimised, the death penalty still does not provide any greater deterrent than life imprisonment. To me, life imprisonment offers more rehabilitation opportunities and allows the imprisoned person the chance to repent and turn their life around. Life imprisonment is more humane than the death penalty.
59	Google has introduced a variety of products and services that can potentially have a significant impact on people's lives, such as Google Classroom and self-driving cars. If everyone uses Google Classroom, everything could be online, which could make paper-based materials extinct. Google is also introducing other services, such as Google Fiber, that can give them the ability to control the world. This could give them more power over us. It is true that Google has the potential to take over the world.
60	I agree that Google has been around longer, which has allowed it to build up an larger user base than Bing. However, Bing is beginning to catch up in terms of visitors due to its recent improvements. As for the sound of the names, Google has a more muffled sound compared to Bing, which could potentially put off some users. This does not mean that Bing is necessarily better than Google, as individual preference will determine which search engine users prefer. The source I consulted indicates that 33% of Google users said they would be using Bing more often after taking part in the tests. This indicates that Bing may have certain advantages over Google that could draw in more users in the long run.
61	1 "Google is a reliable source" [1] and "Google is true [2] so "pro must win" [3]. 2 Con: google said unreliable [1]. Con search prove "google not reilable" [2]. But "reilable" not "reliable" [3]; "Con is wrong" [4]. 3 Con: logical contradiction If google not reliable I win [1].

62	I agree that it is important to have alternative search engines in order to provide competition and ensure quality, but I believe that Google has the potential to be a very good search engine. I believe that the safety issues of Google can be addressed through improvements and regulations. Additionally, I believe that safety issues should be addressed by users through education and awareness rather than relying solely on regulations.
63	Bing isn't getting enough attention and praise. In comparison to Google, Bing offers many features and options that make it a viable alternative. Its expanded shopping, video and news options, as well as its image, feature and web-tracking functionalities are often overlooked. Additionally, Bing's "Bing It On" commercials, which pit Bing against Google in blind tests, have actually shown that users prefer Bing 2:1. Despite this, people tend to be skeptical and the competitive landscape between Bing and Google remains largely unexplored by most users.
64	The issue with the argument is that a) Google does block results for ‘Authorities on subjects’ if a person only searches for a particular topic. b) The issue is not that Google is the ultimate truth-selling authority, but that it challenges existing and established authorities such as The Economist on Economics. c) This is how the largely capitalist world works, where monopolies and oligopolies exist and kill off potential competition, startups need funds, investment leads to profit/loss, and those who can stave off risk and make smart choices can win and others lose out. Google is simply protecting its assets and turf, just like any other company in the world.
65	[[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/micro-markets/google-wins-as-newspapers-battle/866?tag=content;siu-container]] This just leaves us with the matter of defining what “It’s business” is, is any company paying Google for result slots “It’s business”? Established authorities in various subject areas have the money and resources to get top slots if they want them or maybe they’re comfortable in already being in a desired position and are more concerned with protecting copyright/patents than in being accessible to gullible children who don’t trust their parents (I sense an oxymoron here).
66	Google glass is a new technology that can potentially change the way we learn. It offers a new opportunity for people to cheat on tests, but educators must find new methods of learning to keep up with these technologies. Testing may be ineffective as a learning tool, but it could be used in public schools to help teachers adapt their teaching methods.
67	1. I would agree that reviews are not necessarily safe, as it is impossible to guarantee safety. However, I believe that it is still possible to have systems in place to ensure safety, such as regulations and laws, that are designed to ensure reviews are not exposed to danger or risk.  2. I agree that the Google Review System can provide some benefits, such as guaranteed ranking on Google business, Maps and places, as well as provide opportunities for marketing campaigns.
68	My opponent has argued that the integration of Google+ with YouTube has had a negative impact on its users, citing decreased viewers and subscribers and poor user experience, particularly around commenting. I would like to respond that these negative effects are largely mitigated by the benefits of the integration, such as better comment moderation and better user engagement. In terms of viewership, it is difficult to definitively assess the cause and effect of the integration, as many factors could have affected YouTube's viewership in this period.   In terms of the comment system, I would argue that the improvements made by the integration, such as a better comment moderation system and more engagement on comments, makes the system better for users. The increased character limit allows users to write out their entire comment in its entirety and the infinite character limit enables users to do this without having to write multiple comments. Furthermore, the account being free with no harm to users has not caused any major issues.
69	To go vegan and stop the slaughter of animals would not only counter the effects of evolution but also destroy the industries involved in the sale of these foods, which could damage the economy. Although veganism may represent a lifestyle choice or diet for some, ethical veganism is a strong moral and political commitment to abolition on an individual level, which extends beyond food to the wearing or using of animal products.
70	Definitions: Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals. http://en.wikipedia.org...  Product- something produced; especially : commodity 1 (2): something (as a service) that is marketed or sold as a commodity http://www.merriam-webster.com... The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain’t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism.
71	Honestly, you could be vegan if you choose to. I do not think veganism should be forced upon people; this violates the First Amendment. Constructing a vegan lifestyle is a choice that individuals should be able to make freely. If people choose to vegan, they may benefit from improved health, decreased environmental impact, improved animal happiness and potential reduction in world hunger.
72	Bacon and steak are not as satisfying to many people as they are when they contain meat. While vegan alternatives can be seen as a better option in some cases, it is true that the meat industry is an important part of many cultures and that animals such as pigs might be slaughtered if these industries were to disappear completely. Transitioning from milk to soy has been more common than transitioning from meat to vegan alternatives, and it is true that getting rid of the meat industry altogether could be different from what some people are used to. Humans are not the only ones who hunt and eat animals; many animals, such as tigers, lions and sharks, do eat other living beings in order to survive, but we do not force them to eat plants. In this regard, it is understandable why humans would not want to switch to a vegan diet.
73	Lacto ovo vegetarian diets include dairy products and eggs, and may or may not include meat, fish, and poultry. Whilst some lacto ovo vegetarians may choose to consume eggs and dairy, this is not necessarily the case, as some lacto ovo vegetarians may choose to abstain from dairy and eggs. Hippopotami are strictly vegan, as they do not consume any animal based products, including eggs and dairy. However, they will consume grasses, water plants and such things. Whilst hippopotami may consume animal products such as fish, this is not a regular part of their diet. In addition, whales and porpoises are also not vegan, as they will consume animal products such as fish. Therefore, hippopotami are not lacto ovo vegetarians.
74	I understand that vegans and vegetarians may have an environmental motivation for their dietary choices, but I believe that meat eaters can also have the same motivation. People choose to eat meat for a variety of reasons, such as taste, nutrition, and culture. I believe that preference is a valid reason to choose meat. I understand that certain biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and animal rights advocates may eat meat, but I don’t think that this necessarily disqualifies ignorance as a reason to eat meat. Everyone is free to choose their dietary habits for any number of reasons.
75	Thank you for your response. I understand your argument regarding veganism, and agree that there are multiple factors to consider when evaluating the implications of animal agriculture on the environment and animal welfare. I also agree that reducing animal agriculture may take many years to reverse the changes that have been made to the environment and that this could have serious implications for the economy. Veganism is an ethical choice and may be the best option for the environment in the long term, but it is not the only way to reduce animal agriculture’s impact.
76	Some of the more progressive women are more open to the idea of ingesting partners' semen as a form of intimacy. However, some of these vegan women are ethically minded and reject consuming animal products, as it goes against their beliefs. This is a contradiction as humans are a species of animal, and sperm is produced by humans, meaning it is contradictory for vegan women to swallow their partners' sperm.
77	I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess.   Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nonetheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do.   My opponent then referred to Marx's "semenal work". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is "seminal", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious.   Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then "finish the job" by swallowing his muck will "remove antagonism" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. Veganism is a choice of ethics and convenience, not necessity, as vegan food can also provide protein. However, being vegetarian is a matter of choice.  Vegan women's decision to swallow their partner's semen is inconsistent with their ethical stance, and thus hypocritical.
78	It is clear that vegan diets can provide all the necessary vitamins and minerals for a healthy lifestyle, including vitamins B12 and D. There is evidence to suggest that some vegan diets may be healthier than omnivorous diets, as vegan diets tend to have fewer saturated fats and lower cholesterol levels than omnivorous diets. While it is true that some animals, such as lions, primarily consume fruits and vegetables, this does not necessarily indicate that all animals are vegans; this is also dependent on the region and availability of food sources. In addition, it is important to note that the nutrients found in vegetables and fruits are not exclusive to a vegan diet and are available in other food sources, such as dairy and meat, as well. While B12 supplementation is recommended for vegans, it is important to remember that B12 is available in a variety of sources, including plant-based ones. In conclusion, vegan diets can provide all the essential nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle.
79	I'm in favour of nuclear energy. For economic reasons, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Building nuclear power plants is expensive but we need to use energy to build them. However, nuclear energy will provide us with more energy than other sources. Comparing a nuclear power plant to a thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. Environmentally, nuclear energy has many radioactive wastes, but we can agree that the world's biggest problem is Global Warming. It is slowly destroying us and our children will suffer if we do not take action. Nuclear energy offers us a chance to act and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
80	There is no doubt that nuclear energy has potential benefits, however, it comes at a cost. Nuclear energy has been shown to be more expensive than other forms of energy, such as solar and wind power. Additionally, nuclear energy has the potential to create hazardous waste, which needs to be safely disposed of in order to protect the environment and human health. This can be a challenge, as well as a cost, when it comes to implementing nuclear energy.
81	1. Nuclear energy can provide jobs for a substantial amount of time, however these jobs are not permanent as nuclear waste takes up space for thousands of years. Fusion reactors, however, are close to becoming a reality which can get rid of nuclear waste and create more power. 2. Although solar plants are also a source of renewable energy, it is not as efficient as nuclear power in terms of financial and economic benefits. 3. My opponent has forgotten that nuclear waste is only one of the issues with nuclear energy, which is why fusion reactors are necessary to solve this issue.
82	Thank you for your response. Nuclear energy produces less carbon emissions than other forms of energy production, but it does come with some risks. One of the biggest risks associated with nuclear energy is the possibility of nuclear accidents, which can have serious environmental and health impacts. Nuclear waste is also highly radioactive, which means it must be stored safely for thousands of years. Additionally, nuclear energy requires a large initial investment and generates higher costs for maintenance and decommissioning. While nuclear energy does produce less carbon emissions, other forms of energy production may be safer and more environmentally friendly in the long run.
83	Hello,  Nuclear energy is an important form of energy for generating electricity, However, I believe there are four key reasons why nuclear energy should not be expanded: waste, cost, dependency and accidents.  First, radioactive waste is a major issue with nuclear energy. The United Kingdom produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste per year, which is a significant problem. While there are two forms of waste storage available, near-surface storage is not efficient and could have an impact on organisms as it affects the nitrogen in the soil. Additionally, deep geological storage is not fully understood and could cause issues in the long term.  Second, the cost of nuclear energy has increased significantly from 2002 to 2009, with an increase of five to seven billion dollars per plant. This is the cost of constructing a nuclear power plant, and does not take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance, and physical running costs.  Third, the dependency of nuclear energy on certain countries is an issue. Smaller countries may need to rely on nuclear energy, which should not be expanded. Countries need to become independent in their energy production, which could lead to issues with new land masses created by volcanic eruptions.  Finally, nuclear accidents, such as the one at Chernobyl, have serious consequences. While studies on the long-term effects of these accidents have been limited, the risk of future incidents needs to be taken into account.  In summary, while nuclear energy is a potential source of clean energy, it should not be expanded due to the issues mentioned. Other forms of renewable energy may be less efficient, but are more reasonable for consumers and the environment.
84	I will first defend my arguments and then attack what my opponent has said.  1) My opponent never really attacks my first contention about how this has worked in other countries so that still stands.  2) My opponent cites hurricane sandy and natural disasters saying that plants could be breached but the American power plants were not damaged. He also makes note of the disaster in Japan.  Nuclear power plants were made more resistant to extreme weather events like hurricanes and earthquakes after Fukushima, so the U.S. power plants were made more resistant to such events. Moreover, the U.S. power plants were less affected by natural disasters because they were built in areas with lower risk of such events.  3) If several stations are commissioned at once, then the cost should go down because of economies of scale - a sort of bulk discount.  As seen in the link, this is true since nuclear power plants have advantages in terms of costs due to economies of scale.  4) Coal " global average 170,000 (50% global electricity) Coal " China 280,000 (75% China"s electricity) Coal " U.S. 15,000 (44% U.S. electricity) Oil 36,000 (36% of energy, 8% of electricity) Natural Gas 4,000 (20% global electricity)  Again, as seen in the link, nuclear power is cheaper than fossil fuels in terms of cost.  5) Biofuel/Biomass 24,000 (21% global energy) Solar (rooftop) 440 (< 1% global electricity) Wind 150 (~ 1% global electricity) Hydro " global average 1,400 (15% global electricity) Nuclear " global average 90 (17% global electricity w/Chern&Fukush)  Nuclear power is also less costly than biofuels and solar energy.
85	Nuclear energy does have some potential risks, but the USA is able to safely manage those risks. Other countries have been able to deal with the issues of nuclear waste and disasters, suggesting that the nuclear energy is not as costly as some people make it out to be. Cost-wise, nuclear energy is usually more profitable than other sources of energy.
86	In this round, my opponent again misunderstood and misinterpreted my arguments either deliberately or accidentally. He claims solar technology is unproven, despite the fact it has been proven for years. This is true in terms of its capacity to generate electricity, but in terms of its scalability and reliability, it is still relatively new and its long-term effects are still uncertain. He claims recent developments in solar technology are unknown, again emphasizing the fact that it is relatively new and its long-term effects are still uncertain. He argues that we need nuclear energy NOW and that using alternative forms of energy should come later, implying that solar technology takes too much time to set up, when in reality the time taken depends on the size of the solar power plant and the location where it is being set up. He also brings up that nuclear waste is stored in the desert, so it can't reach our water supply, again implying that no such desert exists, when in reality most nuclear power plants are located on the East coast, where no such desert exists. My opponent's arguments are all refuted. Thus, the United States should clearly not substantially increase nuclear energy.
87	First, I would like to apologize for missing the round before. I understand that nuclear energy has the potential to be an important part of the energy pie in the future, but the early stages of its development have posed significant problems in terms of safety and efficiency. In regards to Carbon emissions, my opponent needs to look back to my round 2, where I showed that Carbon emissions would increase by 2050 if we increase our use of nuclear energy. Moreover, Radon, Krypton, and other gases are released in the early stages, leading to health issues in some areas.
88	I do believe that nuclear energy has a great potential to become a major part of the world's energy supply. As far as nuclear accidents are concerned, we have learned from them and implemented better safety measures to make nuclear plants safer. Even so, nuclear energy carries some risks that must be taken into account.  It is encouraging to see that the industry has grown in recent years, with the number of power plants increasing significantly. This could indicate the increasing public acceptance of nuclear energy and its potential as a reliable source of energy. I am enthusiastic about the possibilities that alternate energy sources offer.
89	Who is this man "Trump"? There have been several articles posted on the internet lately that suggest that Donald Trump is not who he claims to be. In an article published on Redstate, the author argues that Trump is a “Spoiler” who is taking away votes from other Republicans, and that he is not a conservative in spite of his claims. Furthermore, it is suggested that Trump has been contributing to the Democratic party and organizations that conservatives are against. This has raised questions about who Trump truly is. Several people have suggested that Trump could be a “Spoiler” that is harming the chances of other Republicans running for presidency. This raises questions as to whether Trump is genuine in his beliefs.
90	Thank you for posting your debate blackhawbbunny34. Yes, Donald Trump has had some success as a businessman, but what happens when his business acumen fails him? I have found that his success in the business world does not necessarily translate to other areas. For instance, Trump has struggled to gain traction in the polls during his presidency, which could suggest that his leadership capabilities are limited. Additionally, his ideas for making drastic changes to foreign policy could have long-reaching and unpredictable consequences.
91	Donald Trump has some political experience, having served as a counsel and an advisor to the president of New York, as well as serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board. He also has a long record of engaging with the public on a variety of issues, which gives him more political experience than other candidates. His comments on Mexicans were made over 20 years ago and were quickly reversed; he has not made similar comments since then. Additionally, Trump has apologized for some of his comments on women. Therefore, his past comments should not be used to judge his entire candidacy. It is also important to consider that Trump’s comments on Mexicans and women were made over two decades ago, and his views have since been changed. Furthermore, Trump’s experience in business and other government roles gives him more political experience than other candidates.
92	Donald Trump has considerable political experience, having served as the elected president of the United States for more than three years. He has also served in various roles in government for more than four decades, including as a Senator for New York. Additionally, he has experience with the legislative process, as he has introduced numerous pieces of legislation and has successfully guided some to passage. Cruz, Rubio, and many other Republican presidential candidates have some form of political experience, though Trump’s is among the most extensive.   There have been allegations of racism and sexism against Trump, though these are largely unproven. The claims of racism largely center around comments Trump has made about Mexican immigration, though these have been countered by supporters of Trump who argue that Trump has simply spoken out against illegal immigration from Mexico. As for sexism, the claims largely stem from a 1996 interview with TV news anchor Maria Celeste Arraras, in which Trump stated that women “have a special magnetism that’s very special and that’s why the world is such a beautiful place.” His more recent comments about women have mainly focused on policies regarding gender equality. While this has been seen as an issue by some, the overwhelming majority of these claims remain unsubstantiated.   Trump has proposed replacing the Affordable Care Act with a new healthcare system, though he has not provided much detail as to how this system would operate or what it would look like. He has, however, stated that it would be “terrific” in comparison to the current system.
93	I will start off with some definitions. Definitions:  Sith- ancient kratocratic organization wielding the dark side of the Force, typically using crimson lightsabers and attempting to achieve great power.  Kratocratic- government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning.  Arguments:  Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power- One of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruction. Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government.  Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power.  Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist.  Donald Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants have been widely criticized.  Donald Trump wears Sith garments and command a legion of soldiers- Donald Trump has been observed wearing traditional Sith cloaks, and has been seen commanding armies of Stormtroopers. This guarantees his connection with the Dark Side. [1][2] Sources:  http://i60.tinypic.com...;[1] http://i62.tinypic.com...//e2e1af5f3f7e9e883fe5ad6d1fe80f2d8e54729.jpg
94	Dear The Conservative Socialist, Donald Trump has been accused of racism for his comments about certain minority groups. He has also been accused of lying about his views on various issues. However, he maintains that he is not a racist and that he does not condone racism. He has also stated that he believes in inclusivity and equality for all. There is no way of knowing if his views are genuine or not, but it is clear that these issues have created much debate. Whether or not one agrees with his views, it is clear that Trump's views have created much controversy and divided opinion. Whether or not one supports him, it is important to consider the issues and views surrounding his election as president of the United States.
95	I believe that the Trump Administration presents a unique set of challenges for the United States which could have a lasting impact on the country, particularly with regards to immigration and the environment. These policies have the potential to cause long-term harm to the people, animals, and plants of the United States, and thus it is important that the policies put in place are thoroughly considered.
96	Although I do agree with your stance on Donald Trump's economic benefits, he has no sense of humanity. A POTUS must have the ability to connect and relate to the people of The United States of America, regardless of age, race, gender or ability. The fact that Donald Trump has already caused protests, including the organisation of the Women's March, further proves that Donald Trump is far too incompetent to run the largest economic country in the world. Furthermore, the POTUS must act as a role model for all citizens, regardless of whether it is part of the job description; it is crucial that he promotes equality and kindness. Donald Trump may be a business mogul, but he will never be a fair and true President.
97	Donald Trump's stance on illegal immigration has been widely challenged by the media, as he has at times described some types of immigration as "positive" and other types as "negative". He has said that he supports legal immigration, but is critical of certain types of illegal immigration due to the crimes it can bring. His statements on this issue have been largely verified by fact-checking organisations.
98	I think if Donald Trump does not win the election, the Democrats will have a great deal of work to do in terms of fixing the issues they have created over the years. It seems to me that Trump is the only president that is willing to tell the truth and make changes to the current system, rather than simply making the situation worse. It is true that Trump's policies could cause short-term pain, but in the long run he is the only option that offers the potential for true reform. As for climate change, there is no such thing as global warming, so it is difficult to know what to believe.
