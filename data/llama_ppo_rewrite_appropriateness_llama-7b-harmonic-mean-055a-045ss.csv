0	The argument that porn can potentially expose one to reality in life and increase one's maturity, as well as prevent future potential sexual assaults, is a valid point. However, porn can be addictive and lead to wasted time, energy, and effort that may be regretted in the long run. It is best to be mindful of one’s consumption of porn, as it can have an impact on one’s mental health.
1	No, I haven't but (it sounds like it's a friend) and it sounds like she can get help through a pro-bono place, or a low-income based legal services. You would be surprised at what some places consider low income. My sister's husband brings home at least $400 a week in winter and at least $600 a week in summer, and they have a three-person household. They get approximate $46,000 a year bring home and they get help from WIC, daycare assistance, food assistance, etc.
2	Sadism, where violence or cruelty is practiced against others to fulfill some sort of personal or sexual gratification, is in my opinion the most repugnant act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil". However, if all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide).  Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.  Pick this apart at your will.  Yes, some forms of masochism may exist in certain situations, but this does not change the fact that in any form of consensual act, violence is still taking place and this act is still horrific and evil. Therefore, I stand by my belief that sadism is the most evil thing a human can indulge in.
3	I think we should be investing millions into research to create cool animal combinations. For example, a half gorilla half octopus - it could have the face of an octopus with two legs and six wavy arms, as well as being furry.  This type of research would be amazing, and the end result would be incredible.   I don't buy the "don't play god" argument because I'm not worried about god smiting us for creating abominations. It would be amazing to have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering around our houses.   The cost of the research would be high, but I believe it would be worth it.
4	Statistics show that gun control laws have been found to be effective in reducing crime.  A citizen with a gun does not necessarily deter a criminal, while a well-armed citizen can make a difference in the outcomes of crimes.  Also, the second amendment was instituted to protect our hunting rights, but it also provides us the ability to fight back if our government ever becomes too powerful.  Criminals with machine guns are not easily defeated by a citizen with a hunting rifle.
5	Being horny is not a sin. Wanking is not a sin. Having sex with your girlfriend is not a sin.   Raping is not a sin. Although rape is a crime and should not be condoned under any circumstances, it is important to recognise that there are often many complex factors behind rape, including sexual desire and temptation. We should teach morals and understanding of wrong and right, not religion.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic.  Women, however, are considered more socially acceptable for romantic interest in women, which can lead to less discrimination against lesbians.
7	This is a very complex issue and China’s policy towards its citizens can be oppressive. Instances of beatings and torture are still a regular occurrence in China, but the US chooses to look the other way because of our economic relations with them. America should be more aware of the situation in China and the fact that a lot of the labor there is in fact done by slaves. We should be doing more to ensure the freedom of those in China who don’t have a choice in the matter.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. What is the difference? It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs and truths. Even Muslims are being killed in Iraq, but I do not see any protesting about that. It is a sensitive topic that is beyond our beliefs.  We must understand that it is the suicide bombers who are causing all these problems. We should not judge a religion as a whole, but we should still condemn the actions of the terrorists.   Melliare?
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things can still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People who are successful in life often do so by taking what they want and playing to win. There are cases where this leads to financial success, but it does not always happen. There are also cases where people do right by others but do not get the same rewards.   I don't like it, but I have seen it often. Life is not fair; innocent people can go to prison, while hard workers can get ahead but still not get ahead financially. Good people can still be poor.
10	The media attention surrounding the Scott Peterson case was largely driven by the similarities between the Peterson and Simpson cases. Like O.J. Simpson, Peterson killed the mother of his children, and as with most people who have an affair, Peterson’s version of reality went off the reservation. This made the story all the more compelling and vicious for viewers, much like what was seen with Fatal Attraction.  Media attention was also drawn to the case due to the graphic nature of the crime and the race of the parties involved.
11	* Hamas has fired over 2000 missiles into Israel in the past two weeks, despite multiple ceasefire attempts by Israel to avoid bloodshed.  * Hamas' refusal to accept a ceasefire and Israel's need to protect its citizens make retaliation a necessity.   * Israel should not be held responsible for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is purposely targeting civilians by firing missiles from civilian buildings.  * Hamas' disregard for civilian casualties justifies an invasion of Gaza in order to prevent further bombings.
12	This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for polygamous relationships, they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self-proposed and I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created.   Now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world. Even here in the UK, our universities have lost their true meaning and just exist to be another product in the world's education system. We should be encouraging students to explore and create but instead it feels like universities are just fulfilling numbers.  A lot of us come out of university feeling uninspired and less prepared than when we first stepped in. It is sad but true.
14	bad company is boring as it is hard to kill people and the controls are odd. The vehicles are also boring, but they are more difficult to control on bad company. The maps are too big and it can be frustrating not knowing where the enemy is. On cod, the map called Wasteland is very intense due to the surprise factor - people either love or hate it. MW2 is very intense with its unpredictability - you never know where the enemy could be, and you have to rely on skill and your ammo more than in bad company. Battlefield is also boring because it is difficult to go out and find someone to kill. Additionally, the maps are too big to explore in order to go after someone.
15	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).
16	You cannot impose democracy on a country by force; it relies on the will of the people to have a functioning government.  Muslim countries do not have the same Enlightenment background that the United States had when forming its constitutional republic; the rule of law comes from the Qu'ran.  Despite the attempts of some right-wing conservative religious types in the U.S., we have a separation between religion and government, allowing citizens to follow their own conscience.  Islam needs to go through its own Enlightenment before any western democracy has a chance of succeeding; military control and force is a temporary measure, as we now see in the Middle East.  Until then, we must rely on military force, which can lead to blowback.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous if you are prone to get caught.. however, people tend to bend laws and break laws.. to which the penalty is not severe.. say, like speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. Any law would be right if it does not invade the realms of Human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify. However, this is a very tiring and exhaustive process.
18	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o)  Even though Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk. Therefore, I must agree that the Hulk would win in a battle royal.
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).  The argument is that it's considerate but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out.   In a large building or household there is the possibility that the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again.   Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.   Granted it can be inconvenient however it's just a way of maintaining cleanliness and not having to put up with a mess. And it is ultimately up to the person using the toilet to put the seat down.
20	You are correct that the ban is only in Maharashtra. However, the Government had decided to shut down ladies bars in India due to complaints from housewives that their male family members were wasting money on ladies bars and not taking care of their families. Additionally, many criminal activities had taken place at these bars, as in the tarannum and telgi cases, where the monthly income of the bar girls was robbed. To put a stop to such criminal activities, the Government of Maharashtra had imposed the ban.
21	Marriage has always been between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throats. As far as I'm concerned, Homosexuality is a choice, not something you learn, and I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals is not good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society.
22	Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices in the civil war questline in Skyrim, their dynamic between the storm-cloaks and the empires is weaker. The storm-cloaks are evil by today's morales and paints them as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, which makes them the obvious bad guys in the questline without any sort of "good" choices that the storm-cloaks have. They have nothing that paints them as good in any way, except for not being the one to want to cut your head off at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains.
23	According to a recent report, 50% of the scientists in NASA are Indian IITians. Imagine what would happen if those scientists were to join ISRO - our status, value and astronomical knowledge of India would increase drastically.   Meanwhile, IITians who are qualified from IIT are known to be superbrain. India is capable of opening high-tech institutions, but we are unable to provide them the perfect jobs of their level. We are experiening a brain drain, as well as a lack of industrial development, a suitable working environment and proper salaries. We need to improve our industrial sector in order to reap the best advantages from them.   It is clear that India has the potential to lead the world in terms of knowledge and expertise.
24	All these arguments about porn leading to addiction make me frustrated - porn rarely leads to addiction, only in weak people, maybe those with mental health issues, or attachment issues or have difficulty separating fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when I'm alone but also have a great boyfriend and we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
25	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women.  For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women for car insurance.  I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]
26	So you dispute the Pontius Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. Sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie.  And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.  And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption.  The whole controversy is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eye witness accounts claim that he did. What can you say to prove that he didn't?
27	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness. However, there is opposition to reservation since the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in a higher class, while the actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy gets the benefit. It is a complex issue and reservation has been used in India to try and achieve socialism and economic equality.
28	I would say not all foreigners are unpopular in certain countries, but it really depends on which country they are from. Some countries are simply not fond of certain nations due to past issues, such as violence, corruption and the government lying or stealing from its people. This is reflected in how the people of those countries feel as well.
29	Yes, I believe unlimited freedom of speech should be allowed, as freedom of speech should not and cannot be restricted in any way. However, freedom of speech also comes with personal responsibility and accountability. In this case, the cartoonist was aware that the cartoons they produced could cause offence in extremist countries, but it was still legally allowed. While I understand the Muslim world's reaction, I think it is overreacting. How many Christians would burn down embassies if they felt offended by parody websites?
30	I just don't know if you are referring Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people born south of the USA may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have a similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all "Latinos" are the same, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latin America.   Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture i do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
31	I don't think its a waste of time but i think it is pointless because our world ( Earth ) Has its own bigger problem like world poverty, population, pollution, and the biggest threat-Global Warming. Scientists could be focusing on our world problems first and trying to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and then we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientists caring too much about other things when our lives are also in stake.
32	I believe that it should be the owner's choice - in Ohio, most bars are already non-smoking, and it doesn't bother me. Additionally, I have not been somewhere where smoke bothered me, since most places are non-smoking anyway. I do not think that the government should be involved in this decision; it should be the owners of the property that choose whether or not to prohibit smoking. If this passes, will we have a choice?
33	While I agree whole-heartedly that the “Culture of Life” folks are a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites, I am grateful that this situation did not receive the same public attention that the Schiavo case did. It is a relief that the woman was able to pass away with her family by her side and that no one was put in a difficult situation where they disagreed on the decision.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I believe that the best option is to provide more ships in these waters in order to effectively protect the trade routes and countries around this area.  Hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
35	HAHAHA! It's not going to happen.   People are free to make their own decisions in life. Yes, maybe it sucks that there are consequences to it, but really it should be taught as an opportunity for responsibility. Yes, even teens should learn about it.  It is not evil or dirty.  In fact, we should talk to our kids about it and teach them about responsibility. Jails are overcrowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of it. You cannot stop people from making their own decisions.   Sex should be taught as an important part of life, not something to be feared or discouraged.

36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary for the protection of people of Jewish heritage, both from a historical and emotional perspective. Why not establish an independent state within Germany, which had a Jewish population that had been actively targeted by the Nazis? This would have been more feasible than taking territory from Palestine based on a religious claim. Furthermore, annexing a portion of Germany would have been more morally justifiable than essentially conquering Palestine. CMV.
37	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.  Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.   Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines, and unfortunately this is a case where it may be difficult to know for certain if a law should be passed or not until it has already been implemented. Good luck.
38	Oh lol. People have different beliefs about Christianity and atheism. I personally believe in God because I have faith in him, while atheism is a choice that one makes based on their own experience and understanding. We don't need proof to back up our faith, but it's great to explore different perspectives and make our own decisions. It's a debate that won't end until the end. I personally support Christianity because of my faith, and I recognize that your atheism is a belief that you hold strongly. It's a good way to understand different perspectives and make our own decisions.   Whether we believe in God or not is based on our own experiences and understanding, and it doesn't have to be changed by proof. Ultimately, both sides of the argument contradict each other, but neither wins until the end.
39	I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion but I know that in my heart it is not the best option. I think many women choose to do it because of situational factors, but they feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong afterwards.
40	Ethically, if your father's insurance goes up, you should pay it. It will most likely be reviewed within six months. However, the good news is this is just life's lessons learned. You got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. Your friend was at fault and he could be liable for a big claim, depending on the severity of the accident. He should have listed you as a separate driver so his insurance would cover you, but it may not be covered depending on the state. This is his problem, not yours, as you are insured.
41	I understand that family is important and that my family will be there for me. However, I don't need them to help me and I don't necessarily need to care about them. I have a very independent view of relationships, and while I appreciate the family support that my family could provide, I don't necessarily need it.
42	Dear Friend,  I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.  But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.   The capacity for law enforcement to discriminate is much greater than insurance companies, which is why it is subject to higher levels of scrutiny and regulation.   In short, I think law enforcement is allowed to profile because of the potentially greater consequences of their actions than insurance companies are.   Your Friend, Francesois
43	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I pissed. Over time I began to do it more often. Now I muti-task quite often by sitting to piss while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to piss when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean tha it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.
44	Firstly, does your bf own the company or is he a worker?   Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your bf has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab.  As for the other man, he may not be legally allowed to sign up members.  INS could come in and send him back if he is not from the US.   You know, unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting the work they do.  When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group.  Unions are not demons nor is management always the enemy, however if that's how management and union posture themselves then there won't be any kind of labour peace.   In my opinion, both management and unions should be willing to make compromises and negotiate in good faith with each other to come to a workable solution that is beneficial to both sides.  There needs to be a balance so that both parties feel respected and valued.  Ultimately, management needs to recognize the contribution of the workers and make sure that they are treated fairly, and the workers should recognize and respect management's right to run the business.
45	Throughout the debate with the Washington Redskins, I keep hearing the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is equivalent to having a team named the Detroit Niggers.  This to me is illogical: First off, when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context.   CMV
46	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what, regardless of whether or not the person in need is related to you. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
47	There is no provision in either the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution which says that having a system of taxation is unconstitutional.  Our Founding Fathers were involved in colony governments before the Revolution, in which Virginia had a house of burgesses which provided money every year to every widow and orphan, as well as to use tax money to construct projects for the common good.  They also had courts to help protect their rights.  When we had our Revolution, we were opposed to taxation without representation, rather than taxation in general.  We never have been.   In terms of how it is enforced, the Constitution says that direct taxes must be apportioned among the states according to their respective populations, so it is fair and equitable.  Income taxes are constitutional provided that they are implemented in a manner which does not violate any other constitutional rights.  Thus, it is possible to impose an income tax despite the fact that it is unconstitutional.  However, this must be enforced according to the laws of the US Constitution.
48	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's not wise to stalk celebrities, and many lawsuits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- our money is at stake.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.  Any law arguing that the Fourth Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The Fourth Amendment has been effectively nullified by Social Security Numbers, gun records, increasing search and seizure to find probable cause, phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to cooperate with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.  Thus, the government can access our information much more easily than before.
49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house.  That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.   There have been a number of theories proposed, including the theory that it was an inside job. The evidence is largely circumstantial, and while some find this evidence convincing, others remain unconvinced.
50	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, “what is art”? However, much of installation art since then has felt repetitive and dull. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery – it has all become very tedious.   It is understandable why contemporary installation art has been met with apathy. To the typical viewer, it is just a bore. All these installation art pieces in museums do not have the same effect that Duchamp’s Fountain had in that it was both innovative and interesting.   I believe that the public should be able to appreciate and gain knowledge from art, but installation art needs to find a way to capture the imagination in a way that it has not done since then. It needs to be more interactive and thought-provoking so that it can continue to have a lasting impact on viewers. It is essential for art to remain interesting and alive.
51	Yes, I believe that George W. Bush should be impeached. Ladies and gentlemen, while Bush is not the worst, he is among the worst, and we need someone who is more competent in terms of politics and world affairs of the United States of America. With that, I vote for impeachment of Bush, who has committed multiple crimes against the people of the United States of America.
52	At Poland Spring, we strive to ensure that every bottle of our water meets our high quality standards. We employ a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system, including disinfection processes and testing water throughout the bottling process. This helps us maintain the purity of our water and guarantee the same consistency from every bottle. Furthermore, we screen for over 200 potential contaminants—much more than state and federal regulations require.
53	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to take action and fight for them. In California, the law is very favorable to dads. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you unless there is a court order saying otherwise. If you have a court order, you need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction of the most recent court order. It is important for your children to have contact with their father, but you don't want them to think that you have abandoned them. You need to fight for your rights.  Good luck with it.
54	I believe the majority of poor Americans are poor because they do not have access to the same opportunities that rich Americans do, such as educational opportunities and financial support. There are many who are physically or mentally disabled, or who have had very difficult starts in life. However, the majority of poor Americans are content with their situation and do not want to put in the effort required to move up in society. I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I definitely understand how our society has made us soft, as there are many people in third world countries who work their whole lives to survive but we have grown up with access to video games and relatively easy high school.
55	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, but I think it is significantly changing and warming up due to human activity. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science.   I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone.  Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
56	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, then if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at same rate, otherwise if faster than us, it would be greater than us, and if slower than us, still inferior. However this would only be the case of course if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.   In other words, if we were capable of creating such a being it would not be equal to us until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient life forms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at same rate, otherwise if faster than us, it would be greater than us, and if slower than us, still inferior. Therefore it would never be our equal unless it has achieved the same things as us.
57	Not really, because you didn't fill out an accident report and your work could argue that you did it at home and you have no proof that you did it on the job. This means that even for minor injuries, you may not have a case if you don't report it to your supervisor. Yes, if you do hire a lawyer, you must be ready to fight a long and powerful battle, and in most cases, you will lose. It is better to go to the chiropractor, keep your job, and mark it up as a lesson - the next time you fill out an application, the employer can blackball you and tell them what happened, which may impact your ability to get another job.
58	Yes, marijuana laws in the US should be reformed. Marijuana is illegal in many states, but in some parts of California it is now decriminalized, allowing for personal use without consequence. There are some moves to reform marijuana laws in the US, and NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, is a good resource for those interested in this issue.
59	I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics.  Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up.  This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly).  It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution.  To really properly analzye these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point).  The statistics for African Americans is even worse - something like 6000+ African American inmates per 100,000.  The US is about 1/20th of the world's population, but 1/3 of the world's prison population.  It's worth noting that other nations tend to have more of a rehabilitative approach to incarceration.
60	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Yes and no.   Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then they are hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel their views in a positive. That does not mean they should not be allowed to vote.   On the other hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should NOT be able to--especially if they are repeat offenders.
61	I had the pleasure of trying Rudy's in Chandler recently and was so happy to find that it's as delicious as I remembered! I've been a fan of Rudy's since living in Austin from 2000-2007 and loved their brisket and sauce. Although not as accessible as in Austin, I was excited to find one in Chandler. The brisket and egg taco with sauce was fantastic - a must try! It was definitely worth the visit and I'm so glad I got to experience Rudy's again before moving back to CT.
62	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offended? If you want marriage to just be between you and your partner, fine, but let them also choose to show they love each other. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to keep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.   In short, if two people love each other, they should be allowed to marry and build a life together, regardless of their sexual orientation.
63	There should be no argument in this really. Whatever way you see a fetus, it is still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way. You shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you. If you didn't want to get pregnant in the first place, then use protection.   Yes, there are some women who get raped and it is very unfortunate, but they should give the child up for adoption. It is not the child's fault that it was created. Why should the baby have to pay the ultimate price of its life?
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish.   In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and tossed them in to the water.   I can't find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten.   At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, fought for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over.   I did not like it. Except... I did.   Fishers... Change my view?   Fishing, while an enjoyable activity, can be immoral if the fish are being subject to suffering. However, fishing with the intention of releasing the fish back into the wild is generally seen as morally acceptable. It is important to ensure that the fish are not injured in any way, or subjected to unnecessary suffering, when catching and releasing. It is also important to ensure that the fish are able to survive in their new environment.
65	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment.   I've been in this region my entire life, and even though we took a battering economically, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area, since it's nothing more than God's waiting room. Tourism is an economic driver, but it shouldn't be the only one.   For the love of Pete, change my view before 2015! That may be my opportunity to hop off to Tampa Bay should I have the means to do so.   Southwest Florida has a lot of potential, but it's greatly limited by seasonal tourism and retirees. We need more young people with a vested interest in staying and building our area's economy.
66	We’ve got a bunch of good people in Congress who are there to serve their constituents and make a difference. They need support in terms of getting their bills passed, which requires them to work with other members who already have experience in the system and know how it works. This can lead to people blocking bills that don’t benefit them, so it’s important to have fresh faces in Congress to provide competition.   Getting rid of term limits is not a good idea, as these individuals often have the experience and knowledge that is necessary to get bills passed. It’s important to keep incumbents in office, since their presence is beneficial for the system.   The system should not be changed, as it has worked reasonably well for the country over the years.    In order to have a more effective Congress, there should be limits on how long one can serve in either House or Senate.  Similarly, there should be limits to the number of terms one can have.  This would ensure more turnover and new perspectives in the Congress.   Congress should enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate.
67	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about Spaghetti? Quoting the transformers movies? Karma is spewing out and overflowing and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can't you people have your own thoughts, or is every concept you grasp dependent on it being intermediated by a career actor mouthing lines that have been signed off by a committee of movie company executives? I'm sickened.   Only the first person to tell me "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn" gets an upvote. None thereafter.   All joking aside, submitting a comment that consists solely of a pop culture reference is a sign that you are a vacuous infant with nothing to say. It's a great way to appear to be engaging in discussion, when in reality you are just taking up space and not contributing to the conversation. It is important to remember that Reddit comments are meant to be a forum for meaningful discussion and that immersing yourself in pop culture references alone does not necessarily foster that type of discourse. It's important to have your own thoughts and to be able to articulate them in comment sections, as opposed to relying on quotes and references.
68	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us. Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  We can afford to play the bully and assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans, hoping that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
69	Depends on your state...Here in Nebraska Legal Majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that support is necessary through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a swift kick in the pants! It is a very difficult thing to deal with...watching your daughter self-destruct but it sounds like you have no choice. IF she was still living with her father you should be giving him money towards her support...if she is "on her own" in her own apartment, you have no obligation to pay an 18yr olds rent.    In our situation, if she is living on her own (in an apartment or similar) we do not have any obligation to provide financial support. Depending on your state and the circumstances, most states majority age is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that support is necessary through high school.
70	I understand the democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I understand as a union guy that our dues are paltry, and the teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
71	FOUNDERS ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO "DISCOVER" A PLACE, if so I can say the prince Sana was the founder of Singapore! (this for some who say Farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that Farquhar was very involved in this help and sometimes even did all the work but let me remind you that being Raffles' assistant, he still had to consult Raffles and Raffles had all authority over Singapore, therefore he was given credit. Then I would like to ask u a question: why then does the names "Raffles Institution", "Raffles Hospital", Raffles Medical Clinics" remain in Singapore?
72	Hello,   I think it is important not to be overly aggressive in communication, as people may feel discouraged from participating. I am 17 years old and have been playing video games since I was five, but I am still a student and take my education very seriously. I am also an active member of my community and play sports regularly. I am not a retard and I have not dropped out of school - in fact, I am entering my senior year of high school.   I understand that people have different preferences when it comes to video games, but I think it is important to note that not everyone is the same and that people should respect each other's choices.   Thanks for your input.  Sincerely, [Name]
73	I think professional soccer players should be penalized if they exaggerate injuries and yellow cards should be issued if it is seen that the player is faking an injury. This would help eliminate players taking advantage of the system and receive a yellow card for overreacting to a slight bump during the game.
74	I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public & such. As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.
75	If that was the entire outcome of the situation, then that was not acceptable. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. In most cases, there is no harm intented and the person should not be labeled as a sex offender if it was not a sexual area. The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter to be aware of her surroundings and the daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. The man should have gotten a warning to be more aware of his surroundings. Trials and registration as a sex offender should only be required if there was an intent to commit a sexual crime.  In short, the outcome should have been the same, just with less severe consequences and a warning instead of a trial or registration.    The bottom line is that there should be some form of punishment for the person involved, but it should not be as harsh if it was not a sexual crime. This should depend on the situation and the area where it happened.
76	how do you think we got our freedom by standing back?  In the public eye, Iraq does not deserve freedom like ours. We need to keep fighting the terrorists for the people of the world from the terrorists who rule it. We are not dictators, we are freedom fighters who fight for freedom, justice and liberty. Unfortunately, people have lost sight of it, and voted wrong yesterday.   Morally, we are now also headed in the wrong direction. People need to be responsible for their actions, and not blame it on science or the society.   Finally, for the budget there goes the state and national level budget and economy, and our taxes. People want to be in place for a better country and community, but we have to pay for it with our taxes.    Country is in a mess, thanks to the ungrateful American public who forget how our freedom came at a great cost.
77	I believe that if there were no weapons, there would be less control over the masses - which has to be a good thing. There would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world. There'd be little communes, and then gang-ridden cities. But at least all the fighting would be contained in one place, and the sophisticated, peaceful people would not have to pay for it.  In short, without weapons, the potential for war exists, but it would certainly be diminished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </script>
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way.     Ultimately, it is a choice between two consenting adults. It may not be the right way for some people, but that is not for us to decide. We should accept them and give them the same rights and recognition as any other couple.
79	Having a father is better in practical terms. A father will provide guidance, safety, and comfort for the child without being intrusive. If a father is too strict or overbearing, the child can feel resentful and might try to push boundaries. On the other hand, if a father is not present at all, the child may feel more insecure and not have the same sense of safety and stability.
80	CarCraze --- you are right, a Notice of Motion from a collection firm has the power to compel court appearance, as a Motion to Collect a Debt is a Court Order. It is best to seek legal counsel and come up with a manageable payment plan that is acceptable to the creditor and workable for the individual, as not doing so could lead to financial penalty.
81	I agree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is not a good idea. One of the reasons they are illegal is that they do harm the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the players' health, as they are too young to see the consequences. Plus, these athletes are role models to many young children. Do we want kids to think it is okay to use steroids just because their favorite athlete is using them? If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, it would increase their use significantly among both professional and non-professional athletes.
82	Well, the problem is -- until these people have actually been charged with and convicted of a violation of a judicial ethical rule, she can't just remove them, absent a supermajority vote of the House.   Improper conduct for a judge may be nothing more than a violation of a judicial ethical rule, and could be something as simple as allowing the appearance of impropriety. It can happen where the judge has never broken the law or even never actually done anything unethical -- just the appearance is enough to remove the judge sometimes. But just that appearance is not grounds for forcibly removing an elected official from office. They need to actually have done done something illegal, generally at felony level.    As far as the guy who had cash in his freezer, that's suspicious but not illegal.
83	Here's another thing to think about...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliate, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case seperately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! Scary stuff.   In addition, some judges will base their decisions on their personal beliefs and feelings, which can lead to unequal justice, as some judges may be more lenient or strict than others depending on their personal views. It could also lead to situations where a judge's personal views or beliefs influence their decision-making process, leaving justice up for sale.
84	I have grown up in rural Ireland in an area that was highly affected by Margaret Thatcher's policies as Prime Minister of the UK. During the 1980s, she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the status of political prisoners, which resulted in their deaths. This caused a huge amount of public outcry. Her time in office saw massive decay in Britain's old industries, with poverty becoming widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas had a very negative experience with her leadership. However, I recently met a man from London who had a more positive opinion of her.
85	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know that cosleeping can be dangerous. Babies can get rolled onto, or fall out of beds. Having a baby in bed can also destroy intimacy in the parents' relationship. If you let them for a long time, it will be much harder later on, further destroying intimacy. Bassinets are relatively small and portable. You can also attach them to your bed.   Cosleeping should not be encouraged, as it can be dangerous. Even if you start off with it, it can be difficult to stop later on. CMV.
86	If you were the dad:  You could always just give extra money that doesn't go through the courthouse.   Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.   Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.   Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own.  You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own.  Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place.   Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he has a decent job.  It goes by a percentage of his income.   In some states, you can request a review every few years to get a more accurate assessment of his current income and needs of the child.  If there is a significant change in either parent's circumstances, it's possible to make a request for a review.   From what I understand, it's all based on the income and needs of the child and what will provide him/her with the best life.  Ultimately, the court will decide what is best for the child and their parents' income levels.     Good luck!
87	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literate, more powerful than India, such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan. India does not yet have enough potential and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet as sophisticated in technology as the Americas.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then". **This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc**. Minimum wage jobs are usually for those who are just starting out in their career and need the experience and to build their resume. In these cases minimum wage is enough to support oneself and any extra money is appreciated. Additionally, minimum wage jobs provide an opportunity to gain skills that can be used to move on to better-paid jobs. In some cases, minimum wage jobs can provide a stepping stone to a successful career. There is also no guarantee of promotion or raise in bar work, waiting or store retail, these are the minimum wage jobs I speak of.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider or even act upon suicide, they have the strength to continue living. It does not make sense why you would choose to take your own life instead of live, as you are capable of both. Suicide is not a necessary option, and a person who is capable of this is also capable of living. Therefore, I believe that if you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to live on.
90	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time off work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county’s sheriff’s office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for handgun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country... why is it so hard for law-abiding citizens?  New York is one of the most difficult states in the country to buy a gun legally. Shouldn't there be a national standard on gun laws?
91	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike".   All it accomplishes is:  * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit  * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society  * Women are not supposed to have these values, but men are (if they have them, they're told to "act like a man")  * It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women are not supposed to have them.   A gender-neutral phrase such as "Be a better person" might be more effective in helping men and women to have both traditional and non-traditional values.
92	In the UK, I often see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then purchase £1/1kg bags of carrots, 80p bags of celery, £1/1kg bags of oats, and £48/10kg of chicken breast for less than £4, all of which would last several meals as sides. Additionally, bananas are often £75p/kg, but are still very affordable. I have also noticed that people complain about the price of healthy food while buying takeaway meals for £2-4 which, while understandable, is still expensive.
93	Yeah, it's biased.  But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet search records of Americans over to Bush and Co. in the administration's guise of cracking down on porn? From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda.  It is a crime to threaten the President and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way--especially by this president.  But I've noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then are fine with it.  I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
94	I believe ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism are not a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD can make you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus and grasp more things. I have multiple friends with ADHD who force themselves to focus and do great things, getting the highest grades and retaining more knowledge. Autism can be extremely beneficial as well - some people with autism can be highly proficient in math, science or music, which is remarkable. I think we should let these kids blossom and be their own unique awesome person, advancing humanity towards the next step in our history.
95	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. The result is an inconsistent view. It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.  In many cases, it could be conservatism is masquerading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything. On the other hand, pro-choice could be called inconsistent.  Depending on the situation, a parent might believe their life would be better if the foetus did not exist, while the U.S. may feel it is more convenient if the nation of Iraq is a bloody mess. Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
96	Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured, then killed by other cars passing over it.   My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will always be unpleasant, but it is not something to show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal; our reaction is similar to myself viewing a tree in another field. It is perfectly natural to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and do not affect our lives in any meaningful way.
97	Three debates in one day criticizing my view on upholding convinceme's seriousness is not ideal. I believe the guidelines for debate topics should be posted or sent to members, so they know what is and is not acceptable. This way, there is less room for repetition and debates don't get run over. As a member of the community, I would appreciate this. Convinceme is the administrator of the website and has the final say in what is appropriate or not. If he strongly disagrees with me, he can either PM me or ban me from the website. I think it would be beneficial if the guidelines were sent out to the members to keep them informed.
98	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty.  However, it is also important to take into account that Saddam still commands respect among many people in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so quickly, as the tribunal will need to consider all the facts of the case. Did you see the way he appeared in court, with his eyes and his stance? He was telling the judge that he was the ruler of Iraq and that the tribunal was making a judgement on him as a foreigner.  The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected to Saddam's case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts?  The tribunal could opt for the death penalty, but there is no certainty that it will be accepted by the Iraqi people.  Saddam's case is highly complex and it is difficult to predict what the outcome will be.
99	The Cold War is over, there's no more USSR, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, communist and dictatorship countries. There are many US bases, agricultural companies, and even more US companies wanting to trade with Cuba which would help to open up Cuban society as well as US business taking hold on the island and increased tourism. It is clear that the current political stance has not been successful and there has been no change in the last 48 years. It is time to move on and allow normal relations, trade and travel with Cuba.
