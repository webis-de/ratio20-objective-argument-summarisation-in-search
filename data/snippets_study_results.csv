Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody.

Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now.

Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices.

I would like an explanation on how the death penalty costs more. ""Innocent people are too often executed"". Please show me cases where people are wrongly executed in the last 20 years or so. The death penalty is not used nearly as much, so i would like some elabortation. ""The death penalty is applied in an unfair manner"". I must have elabortation on this also. Another point i must make, the death penalty is a source of intimidation. If someone kwows the death penalty is strictly enforced, more than likely that person will think twice about committing the crime. Its common sense, if someone knows there are consequences, if a person understands that their life will be taken if they take someone else's life, less crimes will be committed. Now the death penalty is used more and more lightly and criminals know that more than likely nothing too terribly harmful will happen if they were to commit crimes.

I would like an explanation on how the death penalty costs more. ""Innocent people are too often executed"". Please show me cases where people are wrongly executed in the last 20 years or so. The death penalty is not used nearly as much, so i would like some elabortation. ""The death penalty is applied in an unfair manner"". I must have elabortation on this also. Another point i must make, the death penalty is a source of intimidation. If someone kwows the death penalty is strictly enforced, more than likely that person will think twice about committing the crime. Its common sense, if someone knows there are consequences, if a person understands that their life will be taken if they take someone else\'s life, less crimes will be committed. Now the death penalty is used more and more lightly and criminals know that more than likely nothing too terribly harmful will happen if they were to commit crimes. The justice system is becoming more and more relax and the death penalty is one example.

But the truth is we are starting to question how much of a benefit this supposed free trade is when the figures have continuously been rising.

His sentence was commuted to life and he was eventually released on parole and killed again. He has since been executed My final reason for this round is that the death penalty is actually a very good deterrence. If you look at this link: http://www.prodeathpenalty.com... You see a chart. The chart is documenting the number of yearly homicide rate per 100,000 population. The chart also documents the years 1950-2002. Lastly, the chart documents the yearly number of executions.

82,4,84_llama_bart_argsme,"Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency upon nuclear energy there will be a growing need, This is not good because our storage places are limit right now. The cost of nuclear energy is on the rise, From 2002 to 2009 the cost per plant has raised by five to seven billion dollars. This is the cost to begin the construction of a nuclear power plant and doesn't take into consideration the cost of fuel, Maintenance and physical running cost, Let alone real estate and storage cost.

I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody.

Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now.

Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices.

It might be easier to cross borders for regular travelers but lets look at the Sicilian mafia, They are now free to roam all over Europe, The Russian mafia has open borders to travel to England right now and poison people with polonium. The Gypsies can roam all around Europe without obstruction. And finally the migrants from the middle east including ISIS can freely cross from Turkey to anywhere in Europe.

Let me assure him that I have quite a good idea of what opportunity cost means. He then brings in some technical terms with the hopes of confusing us to believe in him. Basically, he brushes off my argument which is the net high costs of remaining in the EU by accusing my data as biased and claiming that the opportunity of free trade justifies the cash. We have to remember that the costs of remaining in the EU have been rising STEADILY these past few years. If it has just been rising the last couple of years, yes, we might still be optimistic. But the truth is we are starting to question how much of a benefit this supposed free trade is when the figures have continuously been rising. When you consider that these costs are almost at par with medical costs in Britain, how long can we trick ourselves into thinking that ""you know, this is all for free trade. All this cost is justified."" And that is why I brought up the countries Norway and Switzerland.

Death penalty or no death penalty. We can shorten the trials. My opponent also needs to take into account how much money it takes to feed someone for life.

States have different Almost all of these non-death penalty states, are generally small states. You also have to take into account gun control and general crime in the area.

(1) with the crimes committed in Minnesota, (2) you will see that Minnesota have generally less crime, whether it be assault, or property, than Texas. You also give a compare country to country. You fail to take into account the general crime and culture of the area there! Rebuttal 3: You have one case where the U.S got it wrong. The burning of the DNA test could've just been an error. That is not a problem with the death penalty. it is a problem with the jobs the cops do on the trail, and can easily be fixed.

In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef.

178,5,84_llama_bart_argsme,"Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon.

There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it.

The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued.

Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a ""sexist"" or ""a rape apologist"" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no if ands and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is ""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities."" and that for feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."". Now that we have established some ground I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, be whatever the hell that you want, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. One major issue that men face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. I have never in my life met a feminist that has agreed with the statement ""Prostate cancer is a feminist issue"" because quite frankly it is not. Many feminists also like to say that MRAs (Men's Rights Activists) are the ones that should be campaigning for male problems but if it really is for everyone then why does feminism not cover everybody's problems. Here I have merely scratched the surface of male problems that feminism does not address such as the fact that 4 times more men commit suicide than women or that 70% of homeless people are estimated to be men or the significantly less jail time for female rapists than men.

77,4,7_llama_argsme_bart,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef.

231,7,15_llama_argsme_bart,"As per the rules of the debate as set by my opponent, this will be my final argument. Since my opponent has failed to formulate a response, I see little need to elaborate much on my previous post. I will merely offer a brief summary of my arguments and this debate as a whole. My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don't consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically concedes the debate by stating ""in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city."" Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let's ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me this debate.

My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don\'t consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically concedes the debate by stating ""in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city."" Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let\'s ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me this debate. I would like to thank the readers for taking the time to read this debate.', 'post_issue': 'Feminism', 'post_rewrite_a': ""My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument.

Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a ""sexist"" or ""a rape apologist"" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no if ands and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is ""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities."" and that for feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."".

272,8,68_bart_llama_argsme,"So that we may set the platform for this debate, I would like to ""reword"" the argument statement to -- ""Is the Google Review Rating System good or bad? "" I would also add that, This is not necessarily the statement I agree with, More so what can be inferred from the context of the debate. Do you agree? As I understand it, But feel free to correct me if I am wrong. These are your supporting arguments to the argument statement above. 1) All reviews are 100 percent safe. 2) Guaranteed ranking on your Google business, Maps, And places 3) It""s a significant component of any prosperous marketing campaign. Do you agree? As it is my turn for a statement, I would first like to object to the following. 1) In your statement you are making an assumption that ""All"" is ""safe"". I would say that it is not possible to have all reviews are safe, Because there is no way to guarantee ""safety"". So that we are on the same page, The listed definition of safe is; protected from or not exposed to danger or risk; not likely to be harmed or lost. I would say there is no way to guarantee even the case where it is ""not likely"". Cities are designed to have all the available resources within reach for the populace to survive. These ""Cities"" have a common understanding of the way things need to work in order to ""function"". ""Cities"" have plenty of ""safety"" regulations that are governed by ""law"" which is enforced in order to ""function"". Even then of the countless number of ways that we have tried to guarantee safety through history--we have never been able to. ""Crime"" does exist within the populace and it is the only 100% certainty I see.

290,8,7_llama_argsme_bart,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax.

322,6,17_llama_argsme_bart,"Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. First off, I reject your definition of feminism. I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism. I also reject your premise, because I stated in my first argument that MODERN feminism is harmful. My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes. Your first argument is invalid, because I never said that men and women weren't intellectually equal (although they generally don't have as much physical strength as men do, which I will provide the proof for below).

323,8,84_llama_bart_argsme,"Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency upon nuclear energy there will be a growing need, This is not good because our storage places are limit right now. The cost of nuclear energy is on the rise, From 2002 to 2009 the cost per plant has raised by five to seven billion dollars.

Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a ""sexist"" or ""a rape apologist"" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no if ands and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is ""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities."" and that for feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."". Now that we have established some ground I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, be whatever the hell that you want, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. One major issue that men face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures.

We have to remember that the costs of remaining in the EU have been rising STEADILY these past few years. If it has just been rising the last couple of years, yes, we might still be optimistic. But the truth is we are starting to question how much of a benefit this supposed free trade is when the figures have continuously been rising.

I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. In early 2015, he brought up the idea that the government should start making deals with hospitals to help low income Americans. Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices. Today, his official healthcare plan affirms that he supports a 100% free market system, where insurance companies must compete nationwide - the exact opposite of universal healthcare. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump).

And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that.

The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there\'s no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn\'t Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn\'t he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He\'s not extremely religious. I\'m okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you\'d be a criminal; the Bible says that we should stone our children if they are disobedient - which is considered murder, and murder is a crime.

To underline this point, although girls don\'t pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx\'s ""semenal work"". If I hadn\'t realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is ""seminal"", but I wouldn\'t do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious. Moving on to my opponent\'s argument, whilst it is true that the woman\'s willingness to gobble her boy off and then ""finish the job"" by swallowing his muck will ""remove antagonism"" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman\'s decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. So, by choosing to swallow her sire\'s semen vegan women are deliberately breaking their vow not to consume animal products and are, therefore, hypocrites. [1] I expect.

In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax.

412,7,84_llama_bart_argsme,"Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency upon nuclear energy there will be a growing need, This is not good because our storage places are limit right now. The cost of nuclear energy is on the rise, From 2002 to 2009 the cost per plant has raised by five to seven billion dollars. This is the cost to begin the construction of a nuclear power plant and doesn't take into consideration the cost of fuel, Maintenance and physical running cost, Let alone real estate and storage cost.

Soon we're going to have to find a different, renewable source of energy to keep us alive and driving our cars. But I don't think the predominant one will be wind energy.

I'm not sure what will top out as the best new energy source when oil hits the can, but I think it will probably be nuclear, at least until we run out of fuel for that too.

Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at.

Let's say that the costs incurred when Britain has to trade with each country separately is higher than the membership fee of being in EU. First of all, economic experts themselves cannot agree whether which scenario is going to incur more cost, especially when you consider that even if Britain does leave the EU it is going to take at least 2 years to gradually leave the EU and to finalise new laws and trade agreements.

My opponent then argues terrorist ideas are home grown, not brought in and therefore an emphasis should be on the education system. I simply cannot agree with this.

473,6,7_llama_argsme_bart,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels.

Even though there have been 7 explosives in the world, 3 of them have been contained and each explosive reaction has happened in a 30-year break.

For the 3 argument, You got me there. Even though the cost is on the rise, Tec has to improve and to improve we need more money. I know cost is going on the rise, But we probably won't keep using nuclear power for long. There one day will be an eco-friendly way of making electricity.

There is a new material called thorium that becomes safe in only 100 years, And we as humans are looking into a way to reuse nuclear power, And by looking into: I mean we are building these generators. To solve the volcano problem we could put a waste facility in the middle of a tectonic plate. Even though there have been 7 explosives in the world, 3 of them have been contained and each explosive reaction has happened in a 30-year break. Scientist say that in 40 more years humans can produce energy in an eco-friendly way, So there will probably be only one more nuclear explosion, And witch tec expanding there might not even be a next explosive. For the 3 argument, You got me there. Even though the cost is on the rise, Tec has to improve and to improve we need more money. I know cost is going on the rise, But we probably won't keep using nuclear power for long. There one day will be an eco-friendly way of making electricity. Nuclear power is more efficient, 300 tonnes of Uranium equals 3500000 tonnes of coal. Also, Did you know that in 2013 NASA did research, And nuclear incident deaths are ranked dead last(including the nuclear explosions) for the most deaths. When we started using nuclear energy we so far have saved 240 gigatonnes of co2 from going into our air. Please, I would like to hear what else is bad about nuclear energy.

478,6,84_llama_bart_argsme,"Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency upon nuclear energy there will be a growing need, This is not good because our storage places are limit right now. The cost of nuclear energy is on the rise, From 2002 to 2009 the cost per plant has raised by five to seven billion dollars. This is the cost to begin the construction of a nuclear power plant and doesn't take into consideration the cost of fuel, Maintenance and physical running cost, Let alone real estate and storage cost.

From a common definition anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage ""climate change"" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people would be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is most than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial.
