In Bad Company 2, the enemies can be more difficult to find as they can hide in cover or pop out from behind obstacles. This can lead to a slower pace of gameplay.

While the government should not be able to intervene in terms of what can and cannot be said, it is important to remember that freedom of speech goes hand in hand with personal responsibility and accountability. The cartoonist knew that the cartoons could cause trouble in extremist countries, and while I acknowledge the Islamic world\u2019s reaction, I believe that their actions go too far and do a disservice to their religion. In many countries, Christians do not act with the same level of outrage over similar cases.", "neutralized_ppo_100a_000ss": "Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that should be respected, as it allows for a wider range of expression. While some countries may find these expressions offensive, it is important that these views are still able to be shared in order to maintain the balance between freedom and responsibility.    In addition, it is important to consider the context in which the speech occurs. Every situation is different, and thus the level of responsibility and accountability should vary depending on the circumstances. Ultimately, it is important to acknowledge that both freedom of speech and responsibility should be taken into consideration when assessing these types of situations."}

This necessitated the adoption of a constitution which outlined specific powers to the federal government and provided a mechanism for taxation to occur within those parameters.  It is also important to remember that while the Constitution specifically outlines the taxation process, it also outlines the process for collecting it, which is typically done by the federal government.

However, fishing with the intention of releasing the fish back into the wild is generally seen as morally acceptable.

While it is likely that fish experience suffering during these events, there may be other factors such as the adrenaline rush of being caught that reduce the level of suffering. As anglers, we must judge these scenarios on a case by case basis.   The same is true for the use of bait fish; while using bait fish to catch larger fish may increase the chance of success, it does involve the death of the bait fish and the anglers must weigh the level of suffering of the bait fish against the potential success of the catch.

It is difficult to determine exactly how different states should regulate gun ownership, as it is largely up to the individual states to decide how they would like to legislate this. There is not yet a national standard on gun control laws and it is important that each state is given the autonomy to decide the best way to ensure public safety while still allowing law-abiding citizens to own guns.
