I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and I drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time.  The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic.  You'd be surprised at the amount of cars that don't pull over right away.  The idiots who don't pull over are usually on the phone, too occupied to pay attention to their surroundings.  Hands free phones don't help that much either.  You can have a conversation in your car with a passenger without much trouble because they can see what's going on with traffic too and sometimes can even point things out for the driver.  The person on the other end of the phone is just a distraction for the driver and offers no help at all.\nPS. Guess what is becoming the biggest excuse/cause for traffice accidents?

As a Firefighter/Paramedic who frequently drives Code 3 (lights and sirens), I can attest that navigating through traffic to reach an emergency is often the most perilous part of my job.

{"topic": "If judges can be bought, does it mean justice is on sale.?", "argument": "Here's another thing to think about...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliate, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case seperately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to \"fix\" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! Scary stuff.", "neutralized": "It's worth considering that while some judges may be susceptible to corruption, they may not be the core issue. The ideal of a judge is to be politically neutral, fair, impartial, and to evaluate each case on its individual merits. However, some judges, including a few recent Supreme Court Justices, seem to disregard this ideal, allowing their political biases to influence their decisions.

{"topic": "U.s., 1/20th of the world's population, 1/3 of the world's prison population. why?", "argument": "I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics.  Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up.  This reflects the US' \"war on crime\" and \"war on drugs\" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly).  It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution.  To really properly analize these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point).  The statistics for african-americans is even worse - something like 6000+ african-american inmates per 100,000.", "neutralized": "I recently attended a lecture discussing these statistics. The crime rate in the U.S. is decreasing, yet the incarceration rate is increasing. This trend can be traced back to the U.S.'s 'war on crime' and 'war on drugs' initiated in the late 70s and early 80s, primarily under Reagan's administration. This suggests that the U.S. is using incarceration as a primary solution. To fully understand these figures, it's crucial to consider the crime rates of other nations as well.

Consider the Spanish La Liga, where Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Atletico Madrid significantly outperform most of their competitors. These matches draw large audiences, including many who might not typically watch a game. Conversely, matches between mid-tier teams don't attract nearly as much attention.
