{"original_argument": "The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises not Lions and Bats.\n\nThe reason one is legal and the other is not, is because the law says one is legal and the other is not.

It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have film two other people having for money if you sell that film commercially. A rational, logical human being would never be able to understand this, which is why it is something only lawyers and politicians could come up with.\n\nThe bottom line is they could make prostitution legal, they chose not to, they could make porn illegal they chose not to.

The legality of one and the illegality of the other is determined by the law. The nuances between the two acts are challenging to discern. It is illegal to engage in sexual activities for money, yet it is entirely legal to do so without monetary exchange. Furthermore, it is illegal to pay for sex, but it is legal to pay two individuals to engage in sexual activities for a commercial film. This paradox may seem incomprehensible to a rational, logical individual, suggesting that such laws are the product of legal and political minds.
