Thong-Wearing Men Arrested at Wal-Mart

AP

SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. - Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a ""triple-dog dare,"" authorities said. 

The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. 

Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. 

Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct. 

When asked why they were wearing thong underwear, one of the men said a friend ""triple-dog dared"" them. They will not be prosecuted, authorities said.",0,0,0,1,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,inappropriate,['Missing Commitment']

There is also very little room to sit and eat inside.
