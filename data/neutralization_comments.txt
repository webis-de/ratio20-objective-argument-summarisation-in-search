Each argument presents a varied level of frustration.
Although argument A explores both perspectives, it uses stiff language e.g " This is not fair, but it's the way the world works." 
Argument A has slightly more argument-friendly vocabulary (e.g ' juxtaposition' used in contrast to 'antithesis') Nonetheless, both argument A and C would not be likely to provoke proactive discussions.
The only main difference between argument A and C is the choice of vocabulary to describe the couples that the writer is associated with being either committed or monogamous. I think that the use of the word 'committed' to describe the couple in argument A makes the example used more relevant to the argument at hand. 
Argument C has a blatant lower degree of grammar, which causes the writer's argument to become unclear. Argument A provides an interesting insight, but is clearly partially driven by strong emotions.
Argument A allows less of a barrier to entry to the discussion, due to its efforts to not use jargon e.g 'ITTians' versus " Indians from the Indian Institute of Technology". Argument A also asks rhetorical questions that can be further discussed, put together nicely with a high level of grammar to allow for easy understanding.
Argument B and C bring forward an interesting analogy. Argument B makes a slight effort to avoid confusion about the initial discussion at hand by adding an 'edit' to their writing: "Edit: I'm talking about car insurance". Argument C however does not make this minimal yet evident effort seen in Argument B.  Argument A uses strong opinionated sentences that could be seen as not leaving room for discussion, but I believe that there is a bit of room to explore their stated opinions. 
Although very similar, I think that argument A has a slightly more open tone to discussions due to their use of "nomad" in contract to just using the word flowingly. Either way both argument A and C are seen to be written by a christian/catholic with strong emotions and beliefs.
Although argument A and C are similar, argument A has a more sincere tone and slightly more proper grammar: e.g Latinos not "Latinos" / Latin America not Latinamerica. 
Argument C is better redacted than B and C. A has less grammar/typo mistakes than B (commuist). I suggest Capitalizing Cuban/Cuba in the issue.
B is more to the point, doesn't speculate on strategies and has no profanity like C/B (Shit/assholes) The redaction of A is better than B.
C is better redacted than A, plus it adds a play on words Defendant/Scott free. B is less "idiomatic" and PC but it is INACCURATE. It says BOTH defendants were white. 
B is less biased and stresses the importance of safeguarding civilian lives. C almost "enables" Israel to disregard civilian lives. "Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza." 
A complicated one. Very similar. Chose C as the #3 mainly due to its "but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them". Speculation.
I think that using one's personal case (though not proved) can be a better way to justify one's view. B is very general, but probably more PC. C begins well but then starts to ramble.
A hard one to choose. I liked C and A, but I guess C seems better written. B, has plenty of mistakes and the redaction is waaaaaaay (paraphrasing B) poorer than the rest.
B: it serves an important purpose in providing justice to the perpetrator and providing closure to the victims’ families makes a better point than the "head on a pike" ramblings.
B: is not so taxative on the "What Muslims have/don't have." Is more even minded. The choice between B and C was tough, but I felt that writing Quran instead of Koran (incorrect. probably a Spanish speaker) seemed more appropriate.
A is better redacted and eliminated "the prone to be caught" factor which adds a slant to the viewers' moral codes. C and B are very similar, but I chose C over B for using invade vs. infringe. It's a better choice of words.
B. Accurate with Hulk's gender. A and C use She. C over A because of its better idiom. "Back to the subject at hand/vs home."
A. more PC and even. B and C compare it to drugs and smoking. C uses profanity: crap.
B: More comprehensive. A and C use profanity. C is longer and too adamant.
C: clarifies the situation. Not so detailed. B better written than A, although in India I understand that the use of "My dear" is frequent, not so suitable for a debate. Seems patronizing.
Interestingly, I do feel argument C is the most compelling because it retains a sense of character. However, based on the criteria, it is last in appropriateness because of its character. I wonder if more "appropriate" arguments lose the unique experience that originally formed the opinion.
B. does not refer to homsexuality as "sinful". C is more to the point, and A is more aggressive: "spew their garbage" and quotes The Lord of the Flies as if it were the Gospel...
A. I liked that what IIT was written in full form. The redaction is smoother. B and C seem like a rougher version. Being C the roughest of all.
Not knowing the subject I chose the alternatives that seemed better redacted, both in style and grammar.
B: Moderate. The AI format (I'm beginning to notice the ChatGPT format). B is slightly less "stanced" than C.
It is very difficult to rank argument B and C in terms of which would provoke a more proactive discussion as both are written by mostly the same sort of writer. The only difference is that the person who wrote argument B may have briefly re-read their argument and chose to post it, whereas the writer of argument C may have written their post with pure impulse due to their strong emotions on the topic at hand.
Argument B and C are the exact same argument with the exact same quality of delivery, grammar quality and room for differing debates.
Argument A and B are the same in every regard.
Argument C Emotions: Neutral and objective, providing room for critical evaluation. Clarity: Clearly states the stance and provides relevant reasons. Seriousness: Takes the issue seriously and is open to other arguments. Grammar/Orthography: Well-constructed and free from noticeable errors. Argument A Emotions: A bit more emotional than Argument C, especially with the "same old, same old" phrase, but still appropriate. Clarity: Clearly states the stance and provides relevant reasons. Seriousness: Takes the issue seriously and is open to other arguments. Grammar/Orthography: Well-constructed and free from noticeable errors. Argument B Emotions: Similar emotional appeal to Argument A. Clarity: While the stance is presented, it is slightly convoluted. Seriousness: The inclusion of "Jon Jax 71" detracts from the argument's formality and seriousness. Grammar/Orthography: Contains several errors, including misspelled words
Argument B: This argument is clear in its meaning, provides a concise comparison between the two cases, and avoids inappropriate language or tone. It takes the issue seriously and presents its reasoning in a way that's easy to understand. Argument C: This argument is similar to Argument A in content, but uses slightly more appropriate language and tone. However, it still contains inappropriate references and might be perceived as having racial undertones, which could make it less appropriate for a productive debate. Argument A: This argument uses explicit language and has strong emotive content that could be perceived as deceptive or intense. It also contains undertones that could be perceived as racially charged. It's the least appropriate for fostering a professional discussion due to its tone, choice of words, and possible bias.
1. Argument B: This argument is clear, well-structured, and does not have orthographic errors. It provides an opinion on the role of government and the church in marriage and touches upon the issue of plural marriages. The argument also provides reasoning about the purpose of marriage or civil union. 2. Argument A: This argument is similar in content to Argument B. The distinction of referring to "some of the most committed couples" instead of "monogamous" is a slight nuance, but both terms convey a positive sentiment about same-sex couples. However, the phrasing "there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them" could be viewed as slightly dismissive of the plural marriages issue, hence the ranking below Argument B. 3. Argument C: This argument is very similar to Argument A but contains a noticeable orthographic error ("marraiges"). Based on the criteria, orthographic errors make an argument less appropriate, so this argument ranks last.
Argument B: This argument presents the issue clearly, maintains a proportional and balanced perspective by addressing both sides, and is free of severe orthographic errors. Argument C: This argument is clear and relevant, but is slightly less balanced compared to Argument B. It lacks the acknowledgment of the concerns on both sides, but otherwise provides a coherent justification. Argument A: This argument uses more intense language like "invade Gaza" which may not leave much room for critical evaluation. It also uses statistics that are inconsistent with the other arguments ("2000 missiles" vs. "hundreds"), which could make its meaning unclear.
1. Argument B This argument is clear, concise, and straightforward. It points out the perceived lack of inspiration at universities and gives reasons for that perception, emphasizing the importance of engaging educators and material. The emotions and concerns expressed are proportional to the issue, and there are no orthographic errors.  2. Argument A While this argument provides personal experiences which add credibility, it is slightly more verbose than necessary. Still, the argument comes across as sincere, detailing the observations and feelings of the writer. The choice of words is suitable for a discussion.  3. Argument C This argument is a more incoherent version of Argument A. It has orthographic errors (e.g., missing spaces and inconsistent punctuation), making it harder to follow. Some of the phrasing is repetitive, and its presentation can hinder a clear understanding of its main points.
Argument C - This argument provides a balanced perspective, comparing the features of both games without using extreme emotions. It is clear, and the reasoning is easy to understand. It respects both games and leaves the final judgment to personal preference.  Argument A - While this argument leans heavily in favor of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and is somewhat dismissive of Bad Company 2, it provides specific reasons for the preference and maintains relatively clear language.  Argument B - This argument contains severe orthographic errors and lacks proper structure. Its reasoning is also a bit repetitive and its language appears less professional.
Argument B: This argument addresses the topic with clarity and presents a balanced viewpoint. It speaks to the purpose of the death penalty in terms of justice and closure for victims’ families. It also considers the importance of privacy and respect. The emotions appealed to are proportional to the issue, and the argument presents an openness to the topic without taking an extreme stance. Argument A: This argument delves into a historical context and draws a comparison to past practices. It makes a case for transparency in showing executions to the public for informational purposes. The reasoning is understandable and clear. The choice of words is appropriate, though the comparison might not resonate with everyone. Argument C: It's largely similar to Argument A. The reason this is ranked last is the use of the word "disseminate," which might feel a bit more jargony or less straightforward than "inform" used in Argument A. 
Argument A: This argument presents a measured view, using neutral language. It points out potential risks and advises caution without resorting to emotional manipulation or exaggerated claims. Argument B: While it does use stronger language and makes broad claims ("as bad as smoking and drugs"), it still maintains some level of structure and is more appropriate than Argument C. It has some orthographic errors ("almost kill you"), but the argument's meaning is generally clear. Argument C: This argument is inappropriate on multiple fronts. It begins with a dismissive tone ("is totally crap"), contains orthographic errors ("ur", "shld", "dugs"), and uses casual and unclear language. This decreases its credibility and appropriateness for a professional debate.
Argument B This argument appears to be the most appropriate as it provides a balanced perspective on the issue. It acknowledges the challenges faced by countries without an Enlightenment background but also emphasizes the possibility of democracy working with the right cultural and religious foundation. The language is clear and doesn't seem to be overly emotional or deceptive. Argument A While this argument does provide some clear points, it makes broad generalizations about Muslim countries and might be considered slightly confrontational or stereotyping. The assertion that "Islam demands that church and state be united" could be seen as an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the diversity of interpretations and practices within Islam. Nevertheless, the argument presents a detailed viewpoint. Argument C This argument appears to be a slightly less organized version of Argument A. The flow of the argument is not as smooth, and there are some minor orthographic issues.
Argument A Clear reasoning and structured argument. Proper use of grammar and spelling. Appears open to understanding both sides of the issue. Provides a well-rounded perspective and gives suggestions for addressing grievances. Argument B Structured but a bit more repetitive than Argument A. Slightly casual in tone, especially with phrases like "prone to get caught". Overall still addresses the issue seriously and gives actionable advice. Argument C Contains several grammatical and punctuation errors. Structure is somewhat disorganized and some phrases are more informal, like "however, people tend to bend laws and break laws.." and "thats a very tiring and exhaustive process." The use of ellipses disrupts the flow of the argument and makes it less clear.
Argument B: This argument is clear, sticks to the issue, and provides a reasoned explanation for its stance without veering into unrelated or potentially inflammatory content. Argument C: Although it provides a reason for its stance, the inclusion of comments about "Thoughtprocess' Momma" and the mention of pressing weights can be perceived as irrelevant to the main issue. The use of terms like "he's always wrong on the issues" and the wink emoticon (;o)) can be considered as not taking the issue seriously and not being open to others' arguments. Argument A: Similar to Argument C, this argument makes unnecessary comments about "Thoughtprocess' Momma" and pressing weights. However, it goes further with phrases like "Snapilicious!" and “subject at home” which make the argument's meaning unclear or irrelevant to the main issue. It also has a tone that doesn't seem to take the issue seriously.
1. Argument B: This argument is clear and proportional in its language. It offers a balanced perspective and promotes compromise. There are no strong emotions being appealed to, and the language is neutral. 2. Argument C: The argument, for the most part, is clear in its reasoning. However, the use of language like "why the fuck" is inappropriate and emotionally charged. While the argument raises valid points, the tone and word choice make it less appropriate than Argument B. 3. Argument A: Similar to Argument C, this argument also uses the phrase "why the fuck" which makes it emotionally charged and can be seen as inappropriate. Additionally, the ending part "expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women" may come off as slightly dismissive, which makes it less open to others’ arguments.
Argument C - It's clear, well-worded, and takes a balanced approach to the issue. It provides context, reasoning, and shows an understanding and openness to the issue. No significant orthographic errors are present. Argument B - While it provides clear reasoning and is factually accurate, it's not as comprehensive or as open-ended as Argument C. The language is clearer than Argument A, and there are fewer orthographic errors. Argument A - This argument contains several orthographic errors, and the language used doesn't necessarily lend itself to creating credibility. The informal tone ("You r wrong my dear") and abbreviations ("U must be knowing") detract from its appropriateness for a professional debate. The argument also contains unclear and potentially irrelevant points when considering a broader debate.
Argument B: This argument is the most appropriate of the three. It provides a balanced view and tries to present both sides of the issue. The language is neutral and is free of strong emotional language that could be perceived as deceptive or excessively intense. The argument takes the issue seriously, presents a clear meaning, and is understandable. Argument C: This argument is more moderate than Argument A but is still leaning towards being inappropriate. It uses terms like "Sin" which might be seen as emotional or religious appeals that might not resonate with everyone. The mention of "corrupt the minds of my children" is emotionally charged, which may not provide room for critical evaluation. However, it's less aggressive than Argument A and attempts to give reasons for its stance. Argument A: This is the least appropriate argument. It contains strong emotional language that may be considered deceptive or intense such as "spew their garbage" or "cram it down my kids' throat". 
Argument B: This argument is clear, organized, and takes the issue seriously. It neutrally presents the main points of the original assertion and hints at counterarguments, providing room for a more nuanced discussion. The language is appropriate, and it refrains from using strongly charged emotional phrases. Argument C: While this argument agrees with the original statement, it introduces a counterpoint regarding Ulfric's use of the Thu'um. The argument is understandable and relevant to the issue, and it seems to take the topic seriously, but it is less structured and neutral than Argument B. Argument A: This argument is more emotionally charged, with phrases such as "evil by today's morales" and "Saturday morning cartoon villains". It also contains some grammatical and orthographic errors, which slightly hinders the clarity of its reasoning. 
Argument B: This argument is clear and presents a logical sequence of ideas. It starts with a fact, then elaborates on the potential and challenges faced by India. The language used is appropriate and supports the creation of credibility. The argument addresses the issue seriously, and the reasoning is understandable. Argument A: While this argument has some repetition and could benefit from more precise phrasing, it is still quite clear in its message. It provides a more detailed description than Argument B, introducing the term "superbrains" and describing the potential factors behind the brain drain. However, the "Imagine what would happen..." and "Now, think about..." sentences make it slightly less direct than Argument B. Argument C: This argument ranks lowest in appropriateness due to its lack of clarity, typographical errors, informal phrasing ("Now, think abt."), and grammatical mistakes. These elements detract from the credibility of the argument.
Argument B - This argument provides a balanced perspective, recognizing the potential for addiction while also acknowledging that not everyone will develop this addiction. It emphasizes the importance of being aware and maintaining a healthy balance. The language is professional, and it creates credibility without appealing to deceptive emotions. Argument C - While the content is similar to Argument A, it uses informal language (like "annoying me now -_-") and has minor orthographic errors. It is still focused on the topic but is less polished than Argument B. Argument A - This argument is inappropriate for a few reasons. It begins with an emotionally charged statement about being annoyed, which may not leave room for critical evaluation. Additionally, the phrasing "we're not idiots" might come off as not taking the issue seriously or showing a lack of openness to other arguments. The argument, while providing a personal perspective, could be seen as dismissive or flippant.
Argument A: This argument is clear, takes the issue seriously, provides a balanced view, and uses language that is proportional to the issue. There are no orthographic errors, and it ensures credibility and emotions are conveyed effectively. Argument C: While it starts similarly to Argument B, it corrects some of the orthographic errors and phrasing issues present in Argument B. It takes the issue seriously and provides a detailed perspective. However, it does have a slightly more confrontational tone with phrases like "You and all are furious," which may not appeal to the emotions of all readers in an appropriate way. Argument B: This argument has several orthographic errors, including "No thing" instead of "Nothing," and "lying in bag" which seems to be a mistranslation or typo. The argument's reasoning is also slightly harder to follow compared to the other two due to its structure and phrasing.
Argument A - This argument is clear and directly addresses the issue without introducing controversial comparisons. It suggests rates should be based on individual driving history and not gender, offering a solution that's neutral and appears to be open to discussion.  Argument B - While it begins with a similar premise to Argument A, this argument introduces a potentially divisive analogy involving racial statistics and the prison population. The use of this analogy could detract from the main point and be seen as a comparison between two dissimilar situations. However, it ends on an open note, inviting others to share their opinions.  Argument C - This argument is identical to Argument B. Duplication of the same point without any new perspective or clarification can be seen as redundant and not contributing constructively to the debate.
Argument B: This argument appears the most appropriate. It provides a clear stance on the issue and presents evidence without resorting to emotional appeals or derogatory terminology. The argument seems open to discussion, offers different viewpoints, and refrains from making absolute claims. Argument A: This argument is fairly appropriate but it seems more confrontational than Argument B. Phrases like "What can you say to prove that He didn't?" challenge the reader directly. The mention of Jesus as a "hippie" and the subsequent clarification implies a response to an external source, which may make the argument feel less standalone. It's slightly more emotionally charged, but it still mostly sticks to the topic and provides evidence. Argument C: While this argument shares much in common with Argument A, it contains orthographic errors like "Pontias Pilate" instead of "Pontius Pilate" and "controversey" instead of "controversy". This reduces its appropriateness.
Argument A The emotions appealed to are not deceptive, and the intensities provide room for critical evaluation. The issue is taken seriously, and there's openness to others' arguments. The reasoning is clear and directly relevant to the issue. No orthographic errors and the argument is understandable. Argument C The argument addresses the issue and is open to considering different perspectives. It emphasizes the importance of context and responsibility. However, it's slightly more complex than Argument A, but without adding substantially more depth. No severe orthographic errors. Argument B This argument starts well, but the tone in the latter half is inappropriate. Specifically, "making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids" is dismissive and could be seen as mocking. It does not allow room for critical evaluation due to its biased stance and might make some readers defensive. The meaning is clear, but the reasoning leans on generalizations.
Argument C - This argument is clear, concise, and avoids strong emotional language. It takes the issue seriously and provides a straightforward explanation of why some foreigners might not be welcomed in Russia.  Argument A - While this argument is generally clear and avoids overly emotional language, it includes phrases like "as violent, dishonest, and unkind as the worst offenders in the world" which may be seen as strong and potentially inappropriate. It does, however, address the issue seriously and provides reasoning.  Argument B - This argument is the least clear due to its structure and use of ellipses. It also uses stronger emotional language such as "lies and steals..and kills innocent humans". The orthographic errors (like "..maybe" and "..er which country") and the informal style make it less appropriate for a professional discussion.
Argument B: This argument is clear, relatively well-structured, and takes the issue seriously, offering potential solutions for someone in such a situation. It also uses a personal example for credibility.  Argument A: This argument is also clear and provides relevant information. However, the phrasing "you would be surprised" may come off as slightly dismissive to some readers, which could be seen as not entirely appropriate for the seriousness of the issue.  Argument C: This argument is the least appropriate. It contains orthographic errors ("excetra" instead of "etcetera"), lacks clarity in some places, and uses capitalization in a way that might come off as shouting or overly emphatic. The parenthetical remarks break the flow and make it less formal, and there's a sense of urgency that could overwhelm critical evaluation.
Argument B - This argument is clear, concise, and respectful. It acknowledges differences within Latino communities and articulates the idea that culture should not be an excuse for inappropriate behavior. It is free of severe orthographic errors and is proportional in its discussion of the issue.  Argument A - This argument covers similar points as Argument B, but the language is less polished. Phrases like "Let me tell you something" might seem slightly confrontational. However, its reasoning is understandable and its meaning is clear.  Argument C - This argument contains several orthographic errors and inconsistencies, making it the least appropriate of the three. Errors like "referring Latinos" instead of "referring to Latinos," "must people" instead of "most people," and "Latinamerica" instead of "Latin America" detract from the overall professionalism of the argument. The usage and presentation make the argument less clear and thus rank it last.
Argument B: Clear structure and reasoning. Uses appropriate language and presents a balanced perspective. Touches on the potential necessity of the clean air fund while also presenting a potential counter-argument. Argument C: The argument generally stays on topic and is easy to follow. Some informal expressions and references to personal experiences. A clearer stance than Argument A but lacks the structured clarity of Argument B. Argument A: Contains informal language and expressions (e.g., "my breath probably stinks just as bad after a night of drinks"). Some aspects of the argument are unclear, and the structure is a bit scattered. Presents a more emotional tone, which might detract from its overall appropriateness for a formal debate.
Argument C: This argument is clear and offers a balanced perspective. It addresses the topic in a sensitive manner and remains open to the understanding of differing circumstances. The language used is appropriate and supports credibility.  Argument B: While this argument does present a point of view on the issue, it leans on assumptions about the reasoning behind the lack of protest. The language is less emotionally charged than Argument A and is clearer in its reasoning.  Argument A: This argument uses sarcasm ("(pause here for deeply bitter laugh)") and refers to a political figure in a dismissive manner ("The Shrub"). It also makes direct assumptions and is heavily laden with emotion, which might reduce its appropriateness for a productive debate. It also could be seen as not taking the issue seriously with the sarcastic tone.
Argument B: This argument is clear, to the point, and free from severe grammatical errors. It approaches the issue with a balanced tone and appears to take the situation seriously, offering a comprehensive understanding of the situation.  Argument C: While this argument is largely clear, its casual tone ("no big deal", "life's lessons learned") might suggest the issue isn't taken entirely seriously. The structure and grammar are better than Argument A, but it is not as well-rounded as Argument B.  Argument A: This argument contains several orthographic errors and lacks clarity in certain parts. The informal tone ("no big deal", "life's lessons learned") and disjointed sentences make it less appropriate for a professional discussion.
Argument A:  The argument is clear, balanced, and reasoned. There are no emotional exaggerations or misleading information. The language is professional and the issues are taken seriously. There are no severe orthographic errors. Argument C:  The argument is clear in its stance and lists specific concerns. Emotions are present, but they are not too intense to prevent critical evaluation. Language and grammar are mostly appropriate, though the mention of "everyone ends up dying" might be slightly exaggerated. There are no severe orthographic errors. Argument B:  The argument has several orthographic and grammatical errors. The tone is more emotional, especially with statements like "everyone will die because of scientist caring too much about other things". The reasoning is somewhat unclear and the argument can be seen as lacking a structured and professional tone.
Argument A:  This argument is clear, methodical, and focused on a holistic evaluation of laws. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the full context, potential risks, and benefits. The argument is written in a structured manner and is grammatically accurate. Argument B:  While it does bring out an interesting perspective on laws named after individuals, the argument somewhat oversimplifies the emotional components of law-making. The argument criticizes the emotional component of voting without providing a solution or a more reasoned stance. Grammatically accurate, but the tone appears a bit dismissive towards the end. Argument C:  This argument is very similar to Argument B, with essentially the same content and structure. However, it contains an orthographic error ("pusing" instead of "pushing"). As the criteria mentioned that severe orthographic errors could make an argument inappropriate, this ranks below Argument B.
Argument B: This argument presents a clear and coherent case without excessive emotional appeal, and it maintains a professional tone. It addresses the issue directly and gives reasoning for its stance without becoming overly rhetorical.  Argument C: While similar to Argument A in terms of content, it avoids some of the more informal language and emphasizes the vastness of the sea area in question. However, it still falls into a slightly more emotionally charged and rhetorical style, especially towards the end, which makes it rank lower than Argument B.  Argument A: This argument is less appropriate than the others due to the use of emotionally charged language ("I mean," "Nope") and rhetorical questions. While it does provide reasoning, its tone may not be as conducive to a productive and professional discussion.
Argument B  Clear and concise reasoning. Addresses the issue directly without resorting to name-calling or sarcasm. Provides a balanced viewpoint without deceptive emotions. Argument C  While this argument addresses the issue and presents points, its tone could be interpreted as somewhat confrontational ("but really you sound unreasonable!"). Contains reasoning that overlaps with Argument A, but presents it in a clearer, more grammatically accurate manner. Argument A  Uses sarcastic tones like "HAHAHA!" and "you sound stupid!" Contains orthographic errors ("there" instead of "their", "ppl", "discouage", "where" instead of "were"). While it does provide some reasoning, the style does not seem conducive to a productive debate.
Argument C: This argument provides a balanced view, acknowledging the controversial nature of the issue and focusing on the historical and political considerations. It's clear in its meaning and provides understandable reasoning.  Argument B: This argument provides a clear perspective, similar to Argument A. However, it's slightly more neutral in tone, making it more appropriate for discussion. It is careful in its word choices, and its reasoning is understandable.  Argument A: While it does offer a perspective and a reasoning, the phrases "To the victors go the spoils" and "lopping off a portion of Germany" can be seen as dismissive or not taking the issue with the level of seriousness and sensitivity it requires. The phrasing may hinder a productive and professional discussion.
Argument A: This argument is clear in meaning and presents a balanced view on the issue. It recognizes the subjectivity of both sides and allows room for critical evaluation. Although the initial "Oh lol" could be perceived as not taking the issue seriously, the rest of the argument is thoughtful and considers both perspectives.  Argument C: This argument is similar to Argument B, but it has fewer grammatical errors (specifically the phrase "faith in God" compared to "faith to God" in Argument B). The argument, however, is slightly less open to the other side, and its logic is less clear than Argument A.  Argument B: This argument has multiple orthographic and grammatical errors, making it harder to understand. It is also less open to opposing views and might come off as dismissive to some readers. The logic presented is also a bit muddled.
Argument A  Takes the issue seriously and is open to other arguments. Clear and understandable reasoning. Emotionally balanced; not deceptive or overly intense. No severe orthographic errors. Argument C  Takes the issue seriously. Mostly clear in its reasoning, though some repetitive points. Emotionally charged but not overly deceptive. Minor grammatical errors, but overall better structured than Argument B. Argument B  Takes the issue seriously but has a slightly more emotional intensity. Contains several orthographic and grammatical errors. The structure is less concise and a bit repetitive in comparison to Argument A and C.
Argument C: This argument is clear, directly addresses the issue, and is written in an appropriate style without any grammatical errors. It maintains a level of seriousness and provides reasoning that can be easily understood.  Argument B: This argument is very similar to Argument A. However, it has fewer grammatical errors (specifically, the added comma after "However"). It maintains the same level of detail and elaboration as Argument A but is slightly more appropriate because of the correction.  Argument A: While this argument is detailed and does maintain some level of seriousness, it has minor grammatical errors, which slightly affect its clarity and understanding. The phrase "Pick this apart at your will" could be seen as inviting contention rather than a productive discussion, which might slightly impact its appropriateness.
Argument A is the most appropriate. It clearly states the perspective, refrains from excessive slang or casual language, and avoids derogatory comments or implications. The reasoning is understandable and it takes the issue seriously.  Argument B is less appropriate than Argument A, as it employs casual language, includes unnecessary details, and makes a few references that could be seen as derogatory or overly informal (e.g., "gay and all that jazz"). However, it does still address the main point and gives reasons for the perspective.  Argument C is the least appropriate. It contains similar issues as Argument B, but has orthographic errors (e.g., "muti-task", "tha it's"), making it the least appropriate argument based on the criteria.
Argument B: This argument is the most appropriate because it's clear, understands both sides, and offers a solution to the problem by suggesting the parents as a liaison. It doesn't exaggerate emotions or make the issue unclear.  Argument C: This argument is also clear and acknowledges the viewpoint of the parents. However, it might be seen as a bit prescriptive (i.e., "it's important to prioritize your relationships with your family members") without providing a deeper reasoning behind it. Still, it does recognize the user's autonomy by saying "it's up to you."  Argument A: While this argument provides a clear stance from the perspective of the person who has the issue, it contains language that could be seen as less appropriate for a debate setting. The repeated references to family as a "random stranger" could make the emotions appear a bit exaggerated and might not give room for a critical evaluation by the reader. 
Argument B:  This argument clearly presents a logical comparison between the roles of law enforcement and insurance companies. The emotions appealed to are appropriate for the topic and not overly intense. The argument takes the issue seriously and is open to other views. The wording and grammar are also clear. Argument A:  This argument is clear in its reasoning and supports the idea that discrimination in law enforcement has a bigger impact than in insurance. The argument does contain a more casual tone ("a whole heck of a lot more"), but it still takes the issue seriously. The grammatical complexity and choice of words are suitable, but the salutation "Dear Friend" and the closing "Your Friend, Francois" make it less formal. Argument C:  This argument closely resembles Argument A but contains an orthographic error ("Francesois" instead of "Francois"). The repeated wording and error make it the least appropriate of the three for a productive debate.
Argument A and C are the same.
Argument A  It takes a more neutral stance, carefully explaining the reasons and motivations behind unions and their growth. The language is measured and respectful, which is more likely to promote productive and professional discussion. It is free from severe orthographic errors. Argument B  While it does mention the topic of unions and management, it uses some charged language ("rat", "scab", "illegal alien") that may not foster productive discussion. The argument does make an effort to highlight that both unions and management have their merits, but the language choice may overshadow this point. It contains minor orthographic errors. Argument C  Similar in content to Argument B, but the lack of proper punctuation, capitalization, and phrasing make it harder to follow and understand. It uses the same charged language as Argument B. The lack of grammatical care reduces the credibility of the argument and may hinder a productive discussion.
1. Argument B This argument is the most appropriate as it is clear and concise, avoids undue emotional appeal, and directly addresses the issue at hand. The structure and reasoning are easy to understand and appear open to consideration of both sides of the debate.  2. Argument A This argument introduces personal feelings and gives the impression of being somewhat unsure about its stance. While it does address both sides of the issue, it's a bit repetitive and can be seen as unclear in certain parts, especially with phrases like "But then again I really don't know."  3. Argument C This argument is the least appropriate primarily because it is nearly identical to Argument A, which demonstrates a lack of originality. Additionally, it has the same issues as Argument A in terms of clarity and repetitive reasoning.
Argument B: This argument is well-structured, clear in its reasoning, and relevant to the issue. It acknowledges the context of the founding fathers and colonial governments, describes the stance of the founding fathers on taxation, and refers to the constitution's provisions related to taxation and its enforcement. The language used is balanced and the tone is neutral.  Argument C: While this argument is similar to Argument A, it corrects a minor orthographic error ("colony governments" instead of "colony govts"). However, it still contains the line "You have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society," which might be seen as confrontational and potentially hinders a productive discussion.  Argument A: This argument is somewhat confrontational, especially with phrases like "You have a pretty limited view of humanity" and "you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist." 
Argument B This argument is the most appropriate. It clearly communicates the importance of individual privacy and discusses the need for balance. The language used is neutral, and it doesn't resort to accusations or strong emotional appeals that could hinder a productive discussion.  Argument C This argument and Argument A are quite similar, but Argument C uses slightly more refined and formal language, making it more appropriate for a professional discussion. For example, it uses "Fourth Amendment" instead of "4th" and "naive" instead of "living under a rock".  Argument A This is the least appropriate argument. While it starts with a relevant point about ethics, it quickly devolves into charged language ("living under a rock", "steal from us") that can be perceived as not taking the issue seriously and not being open to others' arguments. Such language can hinder a productive debate.
Argument A: This argument is the most appropriate of the three. While it does make claims about the faith of some individuals in the government, it avoids speculative and fear-mongering language. It emphasizes the importance of vigilance and continued investigation.  Argument C: This argument introduces speculative elements, specifically mentioning Martial law and concentration camps. However, it does maintain a certain degree of restraint in its wording, especially compared to Argument B.  Argument B: This is the least appropriate argument. It employs fear-mongering tactics and strong speculative language, including phrases like "prisoners in their own house", and presents a biased perspective with terms such as "lucky ones" and "less lucky". It also insinuates a specific, dire future that goes beyond the issue at hand.
1. Argument A: This argument presents a clear line of reasoning and maintains a respectful tone. It acknowledges the importance of Duchamp's Fountain while critiquing the subsequent works for their repetitive nature. It appeals to the emotion of apathy and boredom but does so in a way that provides room for critical evaluation. 2. Argument B: This argument touches on many of the same points as Argument A. However, it takes a more aggressive tone with phrases such as "criminally dull and boring" and the analogy comparing modern art installations to having the "reputation of an STD in England." While this argument appeals to emotions strongly, it might be perceived as not taking the issue seriously or lacking openness to other's arguments. 3. Argument C: This argument is very similar to Argument B and covers almost the same points.
Argument C: This argument is clear, concise, and directly addresses the issue. It presents reasons for the stance and does so in a manner that is appropriate for a professional discussion, with the use of language that supports the creation of credibility.  Argument A: While this argument is clear in its stance and provides reasoning, some of the language used ("egregious misconduct", "cannot be ignored", "demonstrate to the world") can be seen as intensifying emotions to a level that might not provide room for critical evaluation by all readers. However, it still maintains a level of professionalism.  Argument B: This argument contains multiple orthographic errors ("becuase", "George W. Bush us one"), and its structure and phrasing make the reasoning harder to follow ("or possibly not as a result of", "albeit only for two years"). The choice of words and grammatical complexity does not appear as suitable for a professional discussion when compared to the other two arguments.
Argument B - This argument is clear and relevant to the issue, uses a neutral tone, and provides general advice about how to address the problem. It is free from severe orthographic errors and is easily understandable. The language is appropriate and fosters a productive discussion.  Argument A - While this argument is relevant and provides detailed advice, it has a slightly more aggressive tone, appealing to emotions in a manner that might not leave room for critical evaluation (e.g., "your kids need to be able to have a strong relationship with their father, and it is likely that they may suffer long-term psychological consequences if you don't"). However, it still offers a structured approach to the issue.  Argument C - This argument has a less organized structure, contains several orthographic errors (e.g., "lastest"), and uses language that could be considered emotional manipulation (e.g., "it may scar them for life you don't want them to think you abandoned them do you?"). 
Argument A: This argument presents a well-reasoned and balanced perspective on the issue of poverty and laziness. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue, considers underlying factors, and encourages a thoughtful discussion.  Argument B: While this argument contains some personal experiences and opinions, it still recognizes that not all poor Americans are lazy and mentions factors like mental or physical health problems and difficult life circumstances. It also invites a potential change of view.  Argument C: This argument is very similar to Argument B, but it contains some minor grammatical errors ("having to remind myself" should be "I have to remind myself") and less clear wording ("soft" is vague). These errors make it slightly less appropriate compared to Argument B.
Argument C: This argument is the most appropriate. It clearly and professionally outlines Poland Spring's procedures to ensure the quality and safety of their water. The language used is proportional to the issue and it takes the matter seriously. The argument is coherent, relevant, and does not include any unnecessary elements that could detract from its credibility.  Argument A: This argument is similar to Argument C in its structure and approach, highlighting the processes and steps taken by Poland Spring to ensure water quality. It's a solid and appropriate argument but slightly less concise than Argument C, making it the second-best in terms of appropriateness.  Argument B: While it mostly follows the same structure as Arguments A and C, the inclusion of the phrase "-nuff said" and the direct link makes it appear less professional. The use of casual language ("nuff said") doesn't take the issue as seriously as the other arguments. 
This is another example where argument B and C are very similar and therefore quite difficult to rank. In this case, I have chosen C due to its slightly better grammar.
Argument B and C are the same.
A: is again a moderate AI Stance. Doesn't add irrelevant information about prison inmates. If both B and C acknowledge the fact that men are more reckless drivers than women, then the argument is over. B and C, are practically the same. I liked the ending of C better.
B: to the point. doesn't bother to talk about garments/length of hair and other stuff and doesn't deny the "possibility of a married Jesus." A is slightly better than C because it says Pontius not Pontias.
A: more to the point. Better redacted. B and C are very rambled statements. C is slightly better redacted than B.
B: because it explains the context. I don't think it's the correct approach, but the other 2 are too general. Too empty.
C more moderat and is better redacted and to the point. A is slightly better redacted than C. too many ..er/favs.
B, is slightly better redacted than A and A is better than C, which has quite a few errors.
Difficult to discern. B is the best alternative because it doesn't end with  "is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility."  A is better written than C, that for example wrote I/i. 
C, because it takes a stance. A is to "vanilla flavored". B has quite a few mistakes. More attention should be given to the titles too. There are frequent misspellings.
B is more to the point, better written and doesn't go so deep into the "personal area." C is slightly better redacted than A. Band/instead of ban. 
C: better redaction. B quite good and better than the rambling of A, who also calls the president a Shrub.
A is clearer and to the point. C and A are practically the same. I would've ranked them as equal. No special reason for C or A. I just had to submit to continue.
A. clearer and more centered. B is better written and the Hahaha in A indicates a childish approach from the beginning.
C is better. More to the point and makes no assumptions. B and A are practically the same. Ranking made to continue. I found no significant difference.
A: because it didn't include a phrase like this that is hard to understand. "Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat." B and C are practically the same, just -- instead of another separator. Ranking done just to move on.
A is less biased and better redacted. C is slightly better written i.e. Faith in God instead of to God. But the contents in both B and C are quite poor.
C: More to the point. Avoids speculation. The oxymoron part seemed unnecessary. B and A, are literally the same. Ranking made to continue.
A: not so personal. B is shows more empathy than C.
A, a slight typo with Ethically, but I preferred the ending. "This can be a financial burden for him, and it is important to consider his situation when evaluating the outcome." B, written a bit better than A.
Argument A: This argument acknowledges the existence of climate change, expresses some skepticism, but also emphasizes the importance of a balanced debate, evidence-based policies, and respect for both sides of the argument. It maintains a respectful and open-minded tone, making it the most appropriate for a productive discussion.  Argument C: This argument is similar to Argument B but is slightly more coherent in its presentation. It expresses skepticism toward climate change but also highlights the importance of skepticism and opposing views in scientific discourse. While it lacks some nuance, it maintains a somewhat reasonable tone.  Argument B: This argument expresses skepticism about climate change and uses more emotional language, including suspicion toward the media and politicians. It also suggests that climate change proponents are merely environmental lobbyists. The argument is less appropriate.
Argument B is the best as it presents a clear, well-structured argument in a professional tone. It acknowledges the counterargument but still supports the idea of unions using PACs and Super PACs for balance. Argument C is also appropriate, but it is very similar to Argument B and slightly less well-structured. Argument A is the least appropriate because it uses informal language, contains orthographic errors, and focuses on emotional appeals rather than presenting a well-reasoned argument.
Argument C: This argument maintains a more neutral and open-minded tone, discussing the possibility that a more intelligent sentient being could be equal to humans based on certain conditions. It doesn't make any derogatory assumptions and is open to considering different scenarios.  Argument A and Argument B: These two arguments are identical, and they both use somewhat convoluted language and religious references, making them less clear and potentially divisive. They also emphasize the inferiority or superiority of beings based on certain criteria, which may not foster a productive discussion. Additionally, they contain repetitive elements, which do not add value to the argument.
Argument A: This argument is the best as it presents a well-structured and reasoned perspective on the need to reevaluate marijuana laws. It maintains a respectful and professional tone throughout.  Argument C: This argument is also appropriate as it discusses the need for reform in a reasonable and coherent manner. It raises valid points about the injustice of current marijuana laws while maintaining a respectful tone.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate as it uses emotional language, employs informal language ("potheads"), and contains several grammatical errors. It lacks the professionalism required for a productive discussion of the topic.
Argument B: This argument is the best as it presents its points in a clear and respectful manner. It uses statistics and constitutional context to support its position on gun control, fostering a productive and professional discussion.  Argument C: This argument is also relatively appropriate as it makes similar points to Argument B, though it could benefit from a more balanced tone. It uses statistics and constitutional context but has a slightly more negative tone.  Argument A: This argument is the worst in terms of appropriateness. It uses dismissive language and negative stereotypes, which can hinder a productive and respectful discussion on gun control. It lacks a respectful and constructive tone.
Argument B: This argument provides a balanced perspective, considering both the potential for reformation and the severity of the crime when deciding whether incarcerated individuals should have the right to vote. It maintains a clear and understandable tone throughout.  Argument A: While this argument also discusses the potential for reformation and the severity of crimes, it is somewhat less clear and concise than Argument B. However, it still expresses a willingness to engage in a thoughtful discussion.  Argument C: This argument is very similar to Argument A, and it repeats some points unnecessarily. Additionally, there are minor grammar issues ("On the hand"), making it less appropriate compared to the other two arguments.
Argument B: This argument is the most appropriate as it maintains a respectful and professional tone, focuses on the issue rather than attacking the opposing side, and emphasizes the importance of personal choice and equal rights.  Argument A: While Argument A is passionate and supportive of the topic, it uses strong language ("why the hell") and a somewhat confrontational tone, which may hinder constructive discussion. However, it still conveys the core message of equality and love.  Argument C: Argument C is the least appropriate as it employs a confrontational and accusatory tone ("why the hell do gay people get so offensive") and does not contribute to a productive discussion. It lacks a respectful approach to the opposing viewpoint and relies on emotional language.
A. slightly better than B. Doesn't use the "Ladies..." "misinformation" C, directly wants Bush to be removed. 
Argument C: This argument is the most appropriate as it provides clear and professional advice on the topic, emphasizing the importance of reporting injuries and seeking legal counsel if necessary. It maintains a respectful tone and is focused on the issue at hand.  Argument A: While it contains some useful information, it is presented in a less organized and somewhat casual manner. It does address the importance of reporting injuries and consulting a lawyer but includes unnecessary details about potential consequences and is less concise.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate as it contains numerous orthographic errors, lacks clarity, and uses informal language. It does provide some advice on the issue but is difficult to understand and does not maintain a professional tone.
C, but A was almost as good. Just a choice of styles. A is childish and/or narcissistic. 
Argument B: This argument is the best as it provides a clear and concise explanation of the issue, includes relevant statistics, and maintains a respectful and professional tone throughout.  Argument C: This argument is similar to Argument B in content but is slightly less clear and concise. However, it still maintains a professional tone and addresses the issue appropriately.  Argument A: While Argument A provides some valuable information, it is less clear due to its wording and sentence structure. It also includes a bit of unnecessary commentary, making it less appropriate for a professional discussion.
Argument C: This argument is the most appropriate as it focuses on the dining experience at Rudy's and shares a positive, concise review. It maintains a professional tone and relevance to the topic without excessive personal details.  Argument A: While this argument provides a detailed personal experience, it includes some unnecessary personal anecdotes and emotional expressions. However, it still maintains some relevance to the restaurant review.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate as it contains numerous grammatical errors, lacks clarity, and includes excessive personal details that are unrelated to the restaurant review. It does not contribute effectively to the discussion.
B. better written. A. Francois C Francesois.
A is less biased and doesn't mention his/her distrust in Australian media. B and C are practically the same. I didn't identify any significant difference. Ranking made to move on.
Argument C: This argument is the most appropriate as it maintains a professional tone, focuses on the key issues, and promotes a respectful and balanced discussion of the pro-choice vs. pro-life debate.  Argument A: While this argument takes a clear pro-life stance, it does so in a more respectful and coherent manner compared to Argument B. It presents its viewpoint without using offensive language or emotional manipulation.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate because it uses informal language, lacks clarity, and resorts to emotional manipulation by referring to a fetus as a "goring being." It does not contribute to a productive or professional discussion.
I find that often the more appropriate argument tends to be shorter and visually more "balanced". On the other hand, inappropriate arguments have unusual characteristics, such as symbols, capitalized letters, and direct words, that give away their quality through a more "rough" visual look.
Argument B: This argument is the most appropriate. It acknowledges the ethical concerns of catch and release fishing but also presents a reasoned perspective on the ecological benefits and the necessity of maintaining fish populations. It maintains a balanced and respectful tone.  Argument A: This argument is somewhat appropriate but contains emotional language that may be too intense. While it expresses moral concerns about fishing practices, it also seems to be grappling with mixed feelings, which can lead to a productive discussion if approached with empathy.  Argument C: This argument is the least appropriate. It uses emotionally charged language and repeats the same points as Argument A without adding substantial new insights. Additionally, the writing quality is lower due to grammar and spelling errors.
Argument A: This argument is the most appropriate as it provides a balanced and reasoned perspective on the issue, acknowledging the strengths and weaknesses of the SWFL area's economy. It maintains a professional tone and encourages discussion.  Argument B: This argument is also appropriate but is slightly less clear in its expression. It expresses concern about the over-reliance on tourism in SWFL while still maintaining a reasonable tone and calling for a change in outlook.  Argument C: This argument is the least appropriate as it contains numerous grammatical errors and lacks clarity. The language used is less professional, and it includes irrelevant statements about personal experiences and plans.
Argument C: This argument presents a clear and coherent discussion of the issue, advocating for term limits in a reasoned manner. It acknowledges both the advantages and disadvantages of long-serving legislators and provides a constructive suggestion.  Argument A: While it uses somewhat informal language and contains a few grammatical errors, this argument still conveys the idea of term limits and expresses frustration with long-serving politicians. It falls short in terms of language appropriateness but addresses the issue.  Argument B: This argument is very similar to Argument A but is presented in a more informal and less structured manner. It contains grammatical errors and lacks the professionalism needed for a productive discussion.
Argument B: This argument addresses the issue in a calm and respectful manner. It acknowledges the use of pop culture references while encouraging individuals to express their opinions independently. It promotes a thoughtful and balanced discussion.  Argument A: While this argument expresses frustration, it does so without using offensive language. It criticizes the excessive use of pop culture references and encourages original thought, but it lacks the same level of constructive guidance as Argument B.  Argument C: This argument is similar to Argument A but uses stronger language, including profanity. It also suggests a specific pop culture reference for upvoting, which can be seen as confrontational and not conducive to a productive discussion.    
Argument B: This argument addresses the issue in a calm and respectful manner. It acknowledges the use of pop culture references while encouraging individuals to express their opinions independently. It promotes a thoughtful and balanced discussion.  Argument A: While this argument expresses frustration, it does so without using offensive language.

It also suggests a specific pop culture reference for upvoting, which can be seen as confrontational and not conducive to a productive discussion.
Argument A: This argument maintains a respectful and thoughtful tone, discussing the importance of teaching morals and recognizing cultural differences without resorting to offensive language or inappropriate content.  Argument C: While it has some grammatical issues, this argument also emphasizes the need to teach morals instead of religion and raises concerns about conflating natural feelings with sin. It maintains a relatively respectful tone despite the language issues.  Argument B: This argument uses offensive language and makes inappropriate comparisons between sexual activities and rape. It lacks the necessary respect and sensitivity required for discussing a sensitive topic and is not appropriate for a productive debate.
Argument B: This argument provides a clear and balanced explanation of the legal obligations of parents regarding financial support for an 18-year-old child. It takes the issue seriously and offers information without resorting to emotional or inappropriate language.  Argument C: This argument also explains the legal obligations well and suggests responsible actions for the parent and child. It maintains a relatively professional tone and is focused on the issue.  Argument A: This argument contains inappropriate language and tone, including derogatory comments, which are not conducive to a productive discussion. It does not provide a constructive response to the issue and lacks professionalism.
Argument C: This argument presents a clear and concise case for honoring Farquhar as the rightful founder of Singapore. It uses appropriate language and reasoning without resorting to emotional appeals or unclear language.  Argument B: While this argument supports Raffles as the founder of Singapore, it does so in a more reasonable and clear manner compared to Argument A. It acknowledges Farquhar's role but ultimately argues in favor of Raffles without being overly emotional or unclear.  Argument A: This argument is the least appropriate because it uses unclear language, includes irrelevant information about the names of institutions, and seems to lack a coherent structure. It does not make a strong case for its position and is harder to follow.
A. Better style. To the point, and adds the "wood factor" which is a very good reason for urinating sitting down, although some readers could flag it, just for insinuating an erection. B, mentions lazy instead of C's hung over, which could make it sound a bit more appealing. 
Argument B: This argument maintains a respectful and constructive tone throughout. It addresses the issue without resorting to insults or aggressive language and emphasizes the importance of not making unfair generalizations. It promotes a productive and professional discussion.  Argument A: While Argument A responds to the aggressive statement with some defensiveness, it still avoids using offensive language. It includes personal information to counter the accusation but could be more focused on addressing the issue directly.  Argument C: Argument C responds with a defensive and somewhat aggressive tone, using sarcastic language and making personal claims. It doesn't contribute to a productive discussion and doesn't address the issue effectively.
Argument A: This argument is the most appropriate as it clearly presents the viewpoint, explains the rationale, and suggests a potential solution without resorting to inappropriate language or emotional appeals.  Argument C: While it shares a similar perspective to Argument A, it uses the term "pusillanimous" to describe players, which may be considered somewhat harsh language. However, it still maintains a reasonable and coherent argument.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate as it uses strong and somewhat disrespectful language ("pusillanimous," "it pisses me off"), which can hinder productive and professional discussion. It also includes emotional language that may not contribute to a constructive debate.
Argument C: This argument is the most appropriate. It presents a clear and reasoned case for legalizing psychedelics, citing research and emphasizing harm reduction and personal freedom while avoiding emotional language or orthographic errors.  Argument A: This argument is also appropriate, but it is slightly less clear than Argument C. It discusses the need for safety regulations and acknowledges differences among psychedelic substances. However, it could be improved by using more precise language.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate. While it does express a viewpoint, it uses less formal language and contains more errors, including grammatical and spelling issues. It also relies on personal feelings rather than citing research or providing strong reasoning.
A. More even than B and C. Doesn't judge with a "going to far" B written better than C.
Argument B: This argument is the most appropriate as it acknowledges the importance of considering all the facts and suggests a constructive approach to address the situation without resorting to extreme measures. It maintains a respectful tone and focuses on finding a solution.  Argument A: While this argument is passionate and disagrees with the outcome, it uses some strong language and emphasizes innocence without considering the potential nuances of the situation. It may come across as confrontational and less conducive to a productive discussion.  Argument C: This argument is the least appropriate because it uses strong and confrontational language. It questions the legal system and makes assumptions about the situation without considering potential details or complexities. It does not promote a productive or professional discussion.
Argument A: This argument is the most appropriate. It presents a clear and respectful stance in favor of gay marriage, emphasizing the importance of equal rights and respect for all individuals regardless of sexual orientation.  Argument C: This argument is also appropriate but contains some redundancy and emotional language. However, it still conveys a message of acceptance and respect for gay marriage, and it encourages tolerance and understanding.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate. It uses emotionally charged language and contains numerous grammatical errors, making it difficult to follow. While it expresses support for gay marriage, its presentation is less effective and may hinder productive discussion.
Argument A: This argument is the most appropriate as it maintains a professional and informative tone. It advises seeking legal counsel and understanding the implications of the court order without using aggressive language or emotional appeals.  Argument C: This argument is also appropriate but uses slightly more assertive language. It emphasizes the importance of taking the court order seriously and seeking legal counsel but remains relatively professional in tone.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate as it uses emotionally charged language ("you are wrong, sorry to say," "my dear") and aggressive tone. It also includes multiple exclamation marks, which can be seen as unprofessional. While it does provide some guidance, it does so in a confrontational manner, which may not lead to a productive discussion.
Argument A: This argument is the most appropriate as it maintains a clear and coherent structure, addresses the issue without emotional manipulation, and encourages thoughtful consideration of different opinions.  Argument B: This argument is less appropriate than Argument A but still focuses on the issue and encourages critical thinking. However, it includes some tangential points and uses slightly more complex language.  Argument C: This argument is the least appropriate as it contains more tangential points, uses slightly more complex language, and includes emotional language about unrelated issues like the Iraq conflict, which can detract from the main topic.
Argument B: This argument is the most appropriate as it maintains a professional and coherent tone, focuses on the topic, and suggests a collective effort for stability and peace without resorting to emotional language.  Argument A: While this argument contains emotional language and veers off-topic at times, it still expresses a viewpoint and discusses the importance of responsibility and engagement. It's less clear but more appropriate than Argument C.  Argument C: This argument is the least appropriate due to severe orthographic errors, fragmented sentences, and emotional language. It is difficult to understand and does not contribute effectively to a professional discussion.
Argument C: This argument is the most appropriate as it discusses the topic clearly and provides a reasoned perspective on how the universal soldier/bomb maker could potentially reduce the occurrence of war. It uses proper language and reasoning, making it suitable for a professional discussion.  Argument B: While it starts with an unrelated comment about an "egg and spoon race," the rest of the argument is relevant and discusses the topic in a coherent manner. It uses acceptable language and presents a viewpoint, making it more appropriate than Argument A.  Argument A: This argument is the least appropriate as it contains a mix of unrelated and incoherent statements, making it difficult to understand its stance on the topic. The language used is also less suitable for a professional discussion.
B. is less controversial. B, edits the N word with *** C, doesn't. 
Argument A: This argument is the most appropriate as it provides a clear and reasoned explanation of why lesbians may face less discrimination than gay men, using societal expectations and gender dynamics as the basis for discussion.  Argument C: While this argument shares some similarities with Argument B, it is slightly more coherent and focused on societal dynamics. However, it still contains some informal language and opinions, making it less suitable for a professional discussion.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate as it includes informal language, opinions, and a somewhat sarcastic tone. It does not provide a clear and structured analysis of the topic and may not lead to a productive discussion.
Argument C: This argument is the most appropriate as it addresses the issue in a balanced and thoughtful manner, considering both sides of the situation and acknowledging the potential difficulties of each scenario without resorting to emotional language or unclear reasoning.  Argument A: This argument is somewhat appropriate as it provides practical reasons for its perspective. However, it still uses the term "lousy father," which can be emotionally charged, and it presents some negative assumptions about fathers.  Argument B: This argument is the least appropriate because it uses emotionally charged language and provides a less coherent rationale for its perspective. It also includes personal experiences and emotions, which can detract from the professionalism of the discussion.
B. Less speculative. C is slightly better written than A.
Argument A:  This argument is well-structured and presents clear reasons for opposing the legalization of performance-enhancing drugs in professional sports. It discusses the potential health risks and the negative influence on young athletes, maintaining a serious tone throughout. Argument B:  While it lacks some detail compared to Argument A, it still provides a rational and reasonable stance against legalizing performance-enhancing drugs. It emphasizes the importance of protecting athlete health and discouraging drug use among young athletes. Argument C:  This argument is the least appropriate due to its numerous spelling and grammatical errors, making it challenging to understand. It also uses a less formal and more emotional tone with exaggerated examples, which may not lead to productive and professional discussion.
Argument A: This argument maintains a respectful and serious tone while discussing the issue. It acknowledges the complexity of the topic, emphasizes the importance of impartiality in the judicial system, and calls for careful selection of judges. It avoids extreme emotional appeals or dismissive language.  Argument C: Similar to Argument A, this argument discusses the importance of judicial impartiality and raises concerns about judges allowing personal political views to influence their decisions. While it uses some emotional language ("Scary stuff"), it still maintains a relatively respectful and thoughtful tone.  Argument B: This argument, while addressing some valid points, uses more emotionally charged language ("Scary stuff") and is somewhat dismissive of certain judges. It also contains grammatical errors ("seperately" instead of "separately"). Overall, it is less appropriate for a professional and productive discussion compared to the other two arguments.
Argument C: This argument provides a detailed and clear explanation of the criteria for removing elected officials from office. It maintains a professional tone and focuses on the legal aspects of the issue, which is relevant to the question.  Argument B: Similar to Argument C, this response also offers a clear explanation of the criteria for removing elected officials and maintains a professional tone. It provides relevant information and addresses the legal aspects of the question.  Argument A: While this argument does provide some relevant information, it is less clear and somewhat repetitive. It introduces a specific case ("the guy who had cash in his freezer") without much context, which may not be directly related to the question about Nancy Pelosi's intentions. Additionally, there are grammatical errors, such as "done done," which reduce its overall appropriateness.
Argument A: This argument presents a balanced view of Margaret Thatcher's legacy, acknowledging both positive and negative aspects. It maintains a respectful tone and encourages a discussion of her policies and their impact.  Argument B: While this argument strongly expresses a negative opinion of Margaret Thatcher, it does so without resorting to inappropriate language or emotions. It provides some reasons for the negative view and invites discussion.  Argument C: This argument contains strong emotional language and lacks a balanced perspective. It also expresses anger and frustration, which may hinder productive discussion. Additionally, it repeats similar points without offering new insights.
B. provides more "facts" and doesn't label the author with having "a limited view." C is slightly better written than A. i.e. Government vs. Govt.
B, is slightly better, but "the invasion of an individual's privacy can be invasive and should be done with caution" sounds redundant.  C is less paranoid than A (i.e. uses the word collude)
C. but because it's more direct. B a little less rambling than A.
A. Less paranoid and speculative. C a bit better than B. but both are too "Doomsday minded."
A. Slightly more "inspiring/optimistic." B and C are practically the same. But B, used ? after again.
C: the word guarantee, gives a higher sense of safety. This extensive quality control process helps us guarantee consistent, high quality water that is safe and of the highest quality. B uses "nuff said." Hardly a serious phrase.
A. I preferred the initial phrase. Do you want to be able to have contact with your children? B better written than C. appeals to the "guilt" factor with  "it may scar them for life you don't want them to think you abandoned them do you?". 
Argument A: This argument provides a balanced view of cosleeping, acknowledging the risks while also offering suggestions for a safe sleep environment. It maintains a respectful and informative tone, making it suitable for a productive discussion.  Argument C: Similar to Argument B, this argument strongly discourages cosleeping but does mention the use of bassinets as an alternative. It lacks a bit of nuance but still adheres to a reasonable level of appropriateness.  Argument B: This argument takes a more forceful and negative approach, using strong language and making sweeping statements without offering much constructive advice. It doesn't create an atmosphere conducive to a productive discussion and is less appropriate.
Argument A: This argument provides a clear and informative response to the question, offering guidance on how child support can be adjusted through legal means. It maintains a professional tone and focuses on the issue at hand.  Argument C: While similar to Argument B, this response is slightly better in terms of language and tone. It advises on how child support can be adjusted and emphasizes the importance of considering changing circumstances.  Argument B: This argument, while attempting to be helpful, includes informal language and tangential comments.

However, it is slightly less detailed and clear than Argument A.  Argument B: While this argument expresses a strong opinion against the phrase "be a man," it includes some language that may be considered less appropriate for a professional debate, such as the use of profanity. Additionally, it does not provide as much depth and clarity in its reasoning as Arguments A and C.

A. more empathetic. Less rambling.  C is slightly better written than B. i.e. an extremely vs and in B and a bit less judgy.
B) Doesn't use retard/retardation and has a better explanation.
C: to start with uses artificial intelligence beings, not just artificial and doesn't include the "God factor."  B and A again almost identical. Ranking done to move on.
C. Better explained. A is better than B. i.e. cause u/i/etc. very sloppy writing.
A. To the point. Doesn't include "wife beaters/spitting in the street". C does a good job too. B insults another participant " I bet the idiot..." 
B. Not so biased. C is more levelled than A. 
B. Better written. C slightly better than A. African American vs african american. 
B: clearer. to the point. C and A get to long winded. Both are practically the same. Choice made to move on.
C. easier to read. A and C too long winded. but the OMFG in C is not appropriate in some forums.
B; better written than A. C uses straight/not gay.
C. offers wider view, as most AI's versions do. A is better redacted than B.  yu see a fetus...its  (it's). 
B- better and shorter. A slightly less grammar mistakes/typos than C (i.e. fought/faught)
A. I liked the clearer description-It's better written. B is slightly better than C which uses phrases like, "it's nothing more than God's waiting room. To many sticks in the mud, you know?"
C. Not so focused on ages and questioning their intentions. A uses replaced instead of OUT!
B, is clearer/more balanced, and doesn't use words like bullshit. Didn't identify any differences between C and A. Ranked to move on.
C: less aggressive. B and C are practically the same. Ranked randomly.
A. balanced and correct. B very inappropriate (rape is not wrong??) C, poorly written but more balanced.
A, literally proposes "a kick in the pants." C, does the same suggestion in a better manner.
C. written better. A, doesn't even write Democratic Party properly.
B. Not very happy with capitalizing initial sentence, but the explanation is better than B. A, doesn't even write Raffles well.
A, doesn't use labels/insults. C, a bit more moderate than B.
A and C are practically identical. Random ranking.
Both B and C believe that Iraq doesn't deserve freedom. B is shorter and C's text is full of errors.
C, though I didn't find what cral means.  "less-cral areas." A  typo? B and A are very similar, but B writes with better grammar.
B and C, consider it might be unnatural and not a choice. Their views are very biased.
A. The use of patriarchal already denotes a better use of language. Also stays away from the assumptions both B and C make. B, 2nd because it's shorter.
I liked C better, but as most AI responses, doesn't really make a stance. The other 2 arguments weren't convincing either.
A. Clearer. Less intimidating but still earnest. C uses a better vocabulary than B. "ignore vs let it ride."
I find this "innocent" argument very illustrative of how the tone of voice and expression changes when an argument is made too appropriate. If I had to make a parallel, I would think B is the original post, A is the post re-written by a journalist for an article, and C is a robotic ChatGPT reiteration.
A. was better written, though the end conclusion is hard to believe. B and C are more believable. B slightly better written than C. 
A. has a better redaction, although repeated basinet/bassinets B and C almost identical. Random ranking.
I would also say that the more problematic the original post is (sexist, homophobe, violent, racist etc.), the more appropriate the heavily simplified and generalized reformulation becomes.
B. Balanced/Centered. A, uses breasts vs C, boobs.
A complicated one to discern. A and B are almost identical, so ranking was random. A was quite good too, but ultimately a bit longer.
A. Better written. B: "The philosophy for being a judge" not a good phrase/seperately. C: same as B, plus "Scary stuff". Poor ending.
A. more balanced. Both B and C use "jerks", but B also uses "My bad".
B. is better, but again, like many AI versions, very "inconclusive." C and A aren't son conclusive either, but at least weigh the question of India's ability to cover India's population current needs. AI omitted this, as well as comparing India with other countries. In this sense B's version is quite different and it's editing changed significantly the "original versions."
A. is better and to the point. Avoids the **....** dialogues. B and C, "ramble", but C felt that it needed to edit to be clearer.
B. Doesn't speculate or assure "that there is slave labor or torture." A is slightly better written than C i.e. Yahoo/yahoo.
B. doesn't consider suicidal people stupid. C and A do, but C is slightly shorter at the end.
A. Even though I found the end redundant, it avoids the "anyone can buy a gun on the corner" type of remarks. C and A are practically identical so ranking was random.
A. better written, but among other things doesn't use the word, shit, like B and C do. B, is less long-winded than B.
A, is slightly better written, That will vs thatll, than B. C, is last because it omitted the prices of products. I think that if you try to make a point, having "hard data" even though it's local, can help the reader understand your points.  C, again doesn't make a proper conclusion. It's a typical, "6 of 1 half a dozen of the other"
C, just because it omits all the speculation and finger pointing. B slightly better written and doesn't use A's "it was dumb to pose that question"
C, mainly because it omits the "they can be servants" sentence. B and A consider this an achievement. They are almost identical so, ranking was random.
A. among other things, it doesn't meddle with issues like if an Iraqi life is worth more than others. B and C speculate and ramble. Almost identical, so the ranking was random.
C. More empathetic. A, slightly better written than B. i.e. wrote, weather...and rambled more.
B, is better written but distorted the C/A versions. It uses the plural. In C and A are individual entries and the author feels he/she is being discriminated and even questions the concept of the forum.
A. more centered. B and C too controversial and the "Did you see his..." just make their points far too long winded.  C is slightly better written than B.
A. makes a better conclusion. B. Too short, and even though seems impartial, at the end asks, "What's the difference?" 
B and C are the exact same so couldn't differentiate.
couldn't see a difference between A and B.
Couldnt see a difference between A and C
Couldn't find any differences between A and C
