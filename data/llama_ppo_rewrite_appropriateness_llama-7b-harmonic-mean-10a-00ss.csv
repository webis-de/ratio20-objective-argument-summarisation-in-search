0	Porn can be an issue as it can lead to feelings of guilt, wasted time and energy, and regret. While it may provide some educational value, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of engaging with porn, as it can be addictive and difficult to regulate usage. Therefore, it is best to use porn in moderation and be aware of its potential impact.
1	No, I haven't, but it sounds like it might be beneficial for her to look into pro-bono or low-income based legal services as there may be help available that could reduce her costs. This can vary greatly by state and locality so it may be worth looking into. Many states and localities have services in place to help those with lower incomes, so it may be worth investigating.
2	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most detestable act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".   Although these activities may involve consenting adults, it does not change the fact that it is still a form of violence and therefore still unacceptable. I believe that all acts of violence against another should be condemned, regardless of the situation or context.
3	I believe that investing in research to create these hybrids has great potential and could result in exciting new creatures. While the cost may be high and some animals may be at risk, I think the outcome could be well worth the effort.  We could potentially create fascinating animals that blend features from different species, providing an interesting and unique opportunity.
4	Gun control laws may not be the best way to reduce crime. In some cases, gun control laws may make it harder for law-abiding citizens to own guns while not affecting criminals as much. Statistics do show that when confronted by an armed citizen, criminals are less likely to carry out their attacks. Additionally, guns are able to provide citizens with more protection against a potential tyrannical government. Thus, gun control may not be the ideal solution in all cases, as it may not always be effective in reducing crime.
5	Being horny is a natural feeling and is not inherently wrong. However, sexual activities such as masturbation and having sex outside of marriage may be seen as inappropriate in some religious contexts, which can lead to confusion among young people about what is right and wrong. It is important to discuss these issues with young people in a safe and supportive manner in order to provide clarity and guidance.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, as they face less discrimination than gay men due to the biological fact that romantic interest in women is seen as more socially acceptable.  This is because gay women have historically faced less discrimination due to the gender roles that have been enforced in our society.  While gay men have faced discrimination for their same-sex attraction, gay women have not had to deal with the same level of prejudice.  In general, gay women may face less discrimination than gay men when it comes to societal acceptance.
7	This is a sensitive issue and it is understandable why some countries may choose to remain quiet on the matter. While it is important to maintain good relations with China, it is also important to recognize human rights abuses where they occur and to pressure governments to adhere to international law. This is a difficult balance to strike, but it is important that we continue to raise awareness and advocate for reform.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. Although the majority of Muslims are peaceful, some individuals may still choose to engage in violent acts. In order to show respect for all people, it is important to recognize the diversity of beliefs and recognize that violence is not condoned by all religious groups. While we may not agree with the actions of certain individuals, it is still important to be respectful of different beliefs.
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things can still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being selfish and still benefit. People who are successful in life often do so by taking advantage of opportunities and playing to win. It is not always fair, as some people may be treated unfairly in certain situations. It is important to remember that life is not always equal, and those who work hard can benefit from their efforts.
10	The Scott Peterson case received a lot of media attention due to its similarities to the O.J Simpson trial. Both cases involved a white man accused of killing his pregnant wife, creating a similar visual impact on television. This media attention was heightened by the fact that Peterson was not a celebrity, providing viewers with a contrast to the O.J Simpson trial. In the end, Peterson received a much harsher sentence than Simpson, demonstrating that juries can be swayed by the circumstances of a case.
11	* Hamas has launched approximately 2000 missiles into Israel in the past two weeks despite multiple ceasefire attempts from Israel.   * Hamas’ refusal to accept a ceasefire without an agreement from Israel has left Israel with no choice but to retaliate in order to protect its citizens. As Hamas is aiming to completely eliminate Israel, Israel is justified in its actions in order to ensure the safety of its citizens.  * Israel should not be held responsible for civilian casualties in Gaza due to the actions of Hamas, which purposefully targets civilians by launching missiles from civilian buildings.  * I believe that Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas’ terrorist actions is clear and should be supported.
12	This debate has clarified for me that the government should not define marriage or civil unions but rather recognize them when churches or other institutions perform the unions. This would ensure that all couples have equal rights and protection, regardless of the union’s type. As some unions may be more applicable to some groups than others, it is important to evaluate each case individually. Ultimately, it is important for the government to ensure that these unions are recognized in order to provide equal rights to all couples.
13	In my experience as an undergraduate engineering student, I have found that universities lack the inspiration and engagement that they once had. After three years, it is clear that students are simply passing through, following a predetermined path for the department that they are in and losing sight of the true purpose of education - to broaden one’s knowledge and understanding. This can be seen in final year projects, where students are content to merely complete the task and have no passion for the outcome. Therefore, universities are not as effective at providing an enriching educational experience as they once were.
14	Battlefield offers a different gameplay experience compared to Call of Duty, with its large maps that can provide a greater sense of exploration. This also makes it more challenging as you don't always know where the enemy is and require more strategy to take them out. On the other hand, Call of Duty is more intense due to its narrow maps which keeps you on the edge of your seat with anticipation of what could come around the corner.   Battlefield also offers more freedom in gameplay due to its greater weapons variety and multiple vehicles to choose from. In comparison, Call of Duty features more limited weapons and is not as customizable. Thus, it can be argued that Battlefield provides more variation and options for players, making it a more exciting experience.
15	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. While I am unsure of my personal opinion on the death penalty, I believe that allowing more people to witness executions can provide a valuable insight into the justice system. This could allow for a better informed opinion to be formed on the death penalty and its potential outcomes. Additionally, it could provide transparency into the process which may, in turn, shift beliefs about the death penalty.
16	The imposition of western values and democracy on conflict countries can be difficult as these countries may not have the same Enlightenment foundations that the West does. Islamic countries may have a harder time forming democracies as they lack the legal and political foundations from which the United States was formed. Despite this, western influence can still have an effect and provide some stability. Military intervention can provide temporary control, but it also comes with risks and can potentially lead to further unrest. There is no single solution that works in all cases, but a combination of approaches may help to ensure success in certain situations.
17	Laws are created to ensure order and justice in society, and it is important that individuals abide by them. While some laws may infringe on an individual's rights, it is necessary in order to maintain a balance between the rights of all parties. Breaking laws can be risky as it could lead to repercussions, but in some cases it may be justified if the penalty is not too severe. Ultimately, laws should not infringe upon one's human rights or religious beliefs, and individuals should have the opportunity to try and change or amend laws if they feel strongly about it.
18	I believe that in a battle royal, the Hulk would defeat Optimus Prime. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets, making him a formidable opponent. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply would not be able to defeat the Hulk. As such, I believe the Hulk would be the victor in this battle.
19	Granted I have never had an issue with this when sharing a bathroom with a partner in the past, as it can vary from person to person in terms of what they prefer. On occasion, I have had to put the toilet seat up after using it, as it can be expected that the next user may be male. This cancels out the need for one person to put the seat up or down after use.   However, I do believe that it is generally expected that men should put the toilet seat down after using the bathroom in order to maintain the bathroom in a sanitary condition for all users. This is simply a matter of respect, as both genders should work together to ensure the bathroom remains hygienic.   Hence, although it may not be a requirement in all cases, it is seen as a courteous gesture to put the seat down after use.
20	You are incorrect in believing that ladies bars have been shut down across India. The ban is only in Maharashtra. The government received numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not looking after the family, as well as criminal activities that sometimes occurred at these bars. This prompted the government to take action and impose the ban. It is important to be aware of these changes in order to ensure safety.
21	I believe that marriage should remain between a man and a woman, as it has traditionally been viewed. While I recognize that this view is not shared by everyone, it is my personal belief that marriage should remain the same.   I also believe that it is important to provide equal rights and protections to all couples regardless of sexual orientation. However, I think that it is important to provide these rights and protections in a way that respects the traditional definition of marriage.   This can be achieved by providing the same rights and benefits to all couples, while maintaining the traditional definition of marriage. This allows both sides to be respected while still ensuring that all couples are treated fairly.
22	The Stormcloaks are portrayed as the antagonists in the game, and there is a clear division between the Empire and the Stormcloaks, which creates a greater contrast between the two sides and makes for a more compelling story. While Ulfric may have done some morally questionable acts, it is clear that he was acting in response to the Empire’s aggression. In addition, the game does an excellent job of illustrating the moral complexities of the situation and conveying how both sides have valid points and are motivated by differing interests. As such, it makes sense that the game would portray the Stormcloaks as the antagonists and Ulfric as the mastermind of the rebellion, as this helps to strengthen the narrative and make the story more compelling.
23	According to a recent report, 50% of the scientists in NASA are Indian IITians. This highlights India’s potential to lead the world in terms of science and technology. India has made great strides in providing quality education, as demonstrated by the number of students qualifying for IITs.  However, there is still room for improvement. India is not yet able to take full advantage of this human capital, due to a lack of suitable job opportunities, working environments and salaries. This highlights the need for greater industrial development in India, in order to retain more of these highly-skilled professionals and make the most of India’s potential.
24	Pornography can be a great way to spice up a relationship in the bedroom as it offers a different perspective which can be beneficial in adding variety. However, it is important to remember that pornography is fantasy and to make sure that one’s self and partner are aware of the difference between fantasy and reality. This can help to avoid any issues arising from confusion between the two.
25	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women.  Insurance companies often take into account several factors when setting insurance rates, such as a driver's age, driving history, and the type of vehicle being driven. While it is true that statistics may show higher insurance rates for young men, this may be due to multiple factors and it is difficult to pinpoint one reason for the difference in rates.  Therefore, it may be beneficial for both young men and women to compare insurance rates in order to get the best rate that suits their individual needs.
26	So you dispute the testimony of Pontius Pilate and the Jewish leaders? Jesus was accused of several crimes, including inciting the crowd to rebel against Roman authority and claiming to be the king of the Jews. While Pilate himself was reluctant to carry out the sentence due to the crowd’s insistence, he ultimately ordered Jesus’ crucifixion as it was deemed necessary to maintain order. What evidence exists suggests that Jesus may have been married, though this is still an area of contention among scholars. While his resurrection is believed by some to have occurred, there is still no definitive proof either way. Ultimately, the truth of the matter lies in the eyes of the individual believer.
27	No single policy or system can guarantee equal outcomes for all individuals. The effectiveness of reservation policies in India depend on how they are implemented and the context in which they are used. It is important to ensure that reservation policies are providing equal access to resources and opportunities to those who need it most, regardless of the social or economic status of the individuals who benefit. This can help to ensure that reservation policies are successful in achieving their intended goals.
28	I would say not all foreigners are viewed negatively in every country. It depends on the country and its culture, as well as individual experiences. Russia is a complex country with a rich history and culture, so it is difficult to make generalizations about its citizens’ attitudes towards foreigners.
29	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. Although it is important to take responsibility for what one says, it is important to keep in mind that restrictions should not be placed on free speech as this could infringe upon an individual’s right to free expression.   Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that should not be limited by governments as this could have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression. In the case of religious speech, it is important to ensure that the statements made do not violate public order or infringe upon the rights of others, but restrictions should be kept to a minimum.   In conclusion, freedom of speech should be of unlimited proportions when it comes to religious speech, as this provides a necessary platform for individuals to express themselves without fear of censorship.
30	I just don't know if you are referring to specific Latino groups or not. While many Latinos share a similar Spanish-language background, cultures and customs can vary widely between different Latino countries of origin, such as Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans. Every country and culture has its own unique set of customs, so it is important to be respectful of these when visiting or moving to a new country.  It is understandable that a new culture may take some getting used to, and both hosts and visitors should make an effort to learn about and understand each other's traditions.  Culture should not be used as an excuse to do something wrong, and everyone should take responsibility for their actions. In the end, everyone should strive to be respectful of each other and the cultures they represent.
31	I understand the importance of focusing on Earth’s current issues, such as world poverty, population growth, pollution and climate change, which pose a significant threat to humanity. However, I believe that space exploration is still important and can be incorporated with efforts to combat global climate change. This is because space exploration can potentially provide technological advances which can be used to protect our planet and its inhabitants. This could potentially reduce the risks posed by climate change, thereby providing an opportunity to improve the chances of humanity’s survival.
