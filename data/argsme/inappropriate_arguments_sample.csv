climate change,"Global Warming (or climate change in the hot way) is the thing. It is a win or lose election debate topic. It is also very contested in the public field (media). The IPCC states that it exists and that it is human induced. State intervention is often motivated by climate change concerns. However there are many scientists, people and companies that contest climate change or human induced climate change. They have interesting arguments. I believe that they are mistaken. I define human global warming as the abnormal and significant increase of mean global temperatures caused (in part) by human activity. I expect to win if i can show that 1 climate change (in the sense of global warming) exists 2 it is caused in a significant degree by human activity I consider that my opponent wins if he/she is able to negate either of the above. I will affirm 3 arguments to sustain my position: science cvasi-consensus, observable events in the world around us, mental experiment. At this moment there is near consensus between scientists that global warming exists and is human induced[1]. The scientific model is quite simple to understand and makes sense. It is clear that the weather is influenced by many factors, and some are more powerful than others. The greenhouse effect is a powerful factor as shown by the super greenhouse effect on Venus. [2] Green house gases have increased at the highest level in the last 650 000 years after the industrial revolution. [3] To bring the scientific argument down to the human level and to avoid an authority argument i will point out that ice caps are already melting, the first drowned polar bears were found, more violent weather is happening etc. What is more, the arctic ice shows an increase in carbon concentration and temperature.[4] The mental experiment part is more complex in the sense that it involves the concept of positive feed-back. The oceans trap carbon while they are cold, when they heat up they release carbon. This a positive feed-back loop and it means that things will only get worse.[5] . Humans have reached a level where they can affect the climate. Acid rains and other city related weather are examples of humans influencing weather. In conclusion, from the scientific, factual and mental experiment arguments I conclude that global warming exists and it is human induced. Looking forward for a good debate.

climate change,There is an overwhelming scientific consensus climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers. But they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe. There is also overwhelming scientific consensus climate change is being caused by human activity. There are a limited number of circumstances under which free speech can be restricted. One of them is child pornography. The reason that can be banned with violating the 1st Amendment is the harm caused to children in the production of child porn is of such magnitude the normal means of combating bad speech-- more speech is not adequate or sufficient. The ignorance peddled by climate change deniers many of whom like child pornographers do so for greed. Those threatened most by the adverse effects of climate change are children. These will include teenagers sent to fight the increasing number of wars and conflicts which will likely occur. Yes the risk is too high to allow this ignorance to continue to be peddled.

climate change,"The first most obvious mistake my opponent made in their argument was a cherry-picking fallacy. A cherry-picking fallacy is defined as ""When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld. The stronger the withheld evidence, the more fallacious the argument."" [8] As you can see, my opponent, in round 2, only offered evidence which suggests anthropogenic climate change is real, and did not offer any evidence that suggests climate change is due to some other reason. A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. -Stupidape This argument is fallacious because it doesn't take into account direct evidence, and only is about the opinions of climate scientists, who are not infallible. I already pointed this out in my main arguments, but that wasn't meant to be a direct response to my opponent, but a rebuttal on the general claim. In addition, there is room for doubt as long as there is not 100% of climate scientists who agree on this matter, which is not the case. ""Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so..."" -Stupidape This appears to be a Non Sequitur fallacy. This is ""when the conclusion does not follow from the premises. In more informal reasoning, it can be when what is presented as evidence or reason is irrelevant or adds very little to support to the conclusion."" [9] The amount of deaths happened from a heat wave in France. Sudden hot weather in one country doesn't prove that there is global climate change, let alone that it is anthropogenic. In addition, the heat-related deaths in the United States since 2000 has been going down[10], which is odd if supposedly there is significant amounts of warming. But yes, if you look at the graph provided by the EPA there, each of the three spikes in deaths, one in 2000, one soon after 2005, and one soon after 2010, are each going down over time. If you were to draw a straight line representing the average, it would also be going down.

climate change,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax. I await my opponent's argument!",PRO,"The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of",11

climate change,"According to The Center For Biological Diversity, the world’s climate is changing as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels creates carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere, and this causes the world’s temperature to rise. This is likely to reduce the amount of arable land on Earth, and it will cause food prices to increase. Furthermore, climate change is likely to result in rising sea levels. There even are major cities that could be flooded. As the population increases, the production of fossil fuels will increase.

climate change,"The task at hand is to ""...contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent."" From a common definition anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage ""climate change"" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people would be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is most than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is prefect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance.

climate change,"This is as close as the opponent comes to making an argument about cause: ""A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. ' But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.'[0]"" That is the only statement that is close to an argument about cause. Then the source basically states, science does not know, but what if. Then appeals to emotion by asking people to think about their grandchildren, thus action to reduce CO2 must be taken, you know just in case. The question could also be asked, what if the consensus is wrong? The alarmists are advocating for billions of people to reduce their living standards to keep the planet from maybe warming a few degrees. Looking at the analogy mostly used to explain green house effect, which is a green house. A few years ago I was in an empty plastic sheet green house on a sunny but very cold day. The very thin sheet of clear plastic raised the inside temperature significantly, but the owner was planning on disassembling within a few days. My question to the owner was ""would a second sheet of plastic make the green house warmer for longer?"" The owner looked at me and said ""it does not work that way"". There would be an insulation effect if there is a gap between the two sheets of plastic. Yet, this false consensus is asking us to believe that more CO2 equals higher global temperatures. From an idea that more plastic does not make a green house warmer to a question would more CO2 make the Earth warmer. There is research that suggests once there is enough CO2 to have a green house effect more will not cause higher temperatures[1]. This is outside the narrative and must be stopped. Government's need a reason for people to be scared so that controls can be forced on everyone. In summary, consensus is not science! Climate change has become like a religion for those that believe. Western civilization learned centuries ago that state and religion is best separated.

climate change,"What a disappointing debate. The instigator did not provide one thoughtful argument that mankind is causing climate change, only a source that sates 97% of government funded scientists want more funding to study the issue of CO2 causing climate change. Since, scientists just don't know what the cause it requires more study. Yet, alarmist activists want every human on the planet to reduce their living standards based on possible impacts. While, the respondent to this debate provided a simple common sense discussion about the small amounts of CO2 mankind produces compared with nature. Man's less than 4% annual contributions to CO2 emissions would be considered a measurement error in a science lab. If a scientist ran multiple experiments and only had a 4% difference between results it would be considered a success. Yet, alarmists are using this tiny amount as the basis of their argument. In any other context this would be laughed at. Most people that live in cities look around only noticing the tiny part of the planet that men have modified for their comfort. With mankind's continued fight against nature, it would take back the urban areas very quickly. Nature is a robust and complex system. The planet Earth has taken a beating in the past and will in the future. Life will survive, as well as mankind. For a person to state that nature can not handle a 4% increase of CO2 in a complex system is simply naive. The instigators responses were at best weak. The accusation of a cherry picking fallacy is fallacious at best. The total CO2 emissions were included to demonstrate the extremely small amount that mankind was responsible for. Thus, bring in nature's capacity to absorb large amounts of CO2 was not necessary. A 4% error in nature's absorbing capacity and all of mankind's CO2 has be removed from the system. Looking at the IPCC's numbers nature absorbs more than it produces. Using the alarmist's logic, if mankind was not producing excess CO2 the earth would be on the verge of global cooling. There is very few alarmist out there that would be calling for mankind to increase CO2 emissions in this case. Anthropogenic climate change on Venus is a tough sell but I'm sure welfare scientists have requests for funding in at this time. Mankind does not understand planet Earth, and have a geographic advantage. Any attempt at understand Venus' climate is a pretense of knowledge. It could be there is a lot of CO2 due to heat, instead of the opposite.

climate change,"The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term ""climate change"" as- a significant change in the usual climatic conditions especially that thought to be caused by global warming. This 'climate change' can be caused by natural or human induced impacts. The global average temperature has risen by nearly a degree in the past 50 years. Scientists around the world have been recording temperature increases, raised ocean levels and melting of ice caps. All this is evidence that the earth is experiencing a ""climate change"". Many people believe that this change is primarily due to the fact that our CO2 emissions have created more greenhouse gases. They believe that there is a relationship between the rise in temperatures and the rise in CO2 emissions. Data shows an ""association"" between temperature levels and CO2 emissions but does not necessarily prove that increased CO2 levels are the most significant aspect of today""s climate change. For something complex like the weather system, many scientists are needed to unravel the story behind climate change. While most scientists believe climate change occurs, not all agree on the extent and relevance of human activity as an influence on climate change. While major international climate agencies all emphasise the critical role of CO2 emissions in climate change, others are not so sure. For example, some scientists have conducted research that suggests that temperatures were higher than they are today, during the Roman and Medieval periods. These ancient civilisations would not have emitted CO2 emissions as we do today, so why did their temperatures rise? Temperatures have risen and fallen for a long time. The National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) states that climate change over the longer term is mainly due to the amount of sun energy hitting the Earth. Slight changes in the Earth""s orbit and changes in sun ray intensity, can alter the temperatures here on Earth. Even so, most scientists still emphasise the role of CO2 emissions in unprecedented, rapid global warming. The frank fact is that climate change cannot be stopped. It is completely natural.",CON,"Data shows an ""association"" between temperature levels and CO2 emissions but does not necessarily prove that increased CO2 levels are the most significant aspect of today""s climate change. ...

Note - The term greenhouse was used before the invention of the thermostat. A thermostat uses water to regulate temperature so that the temperature remains constant. This is how the Earth climate system works. The more heat that is generated creates more cloud which in turn provides more cooling. Thus, The Earth's temperature remains constant.

climate change,"I thank my opposition for accepting this debate. This discussion is about Climate Change Anomalies from the years 1900 to 2200 (see comments section), and whether they are anthropogenic. Anomalies are deviations from ""schedule"" weather cycles, and can include both hot and cold extremes, making ""global warming"" only half of this discussion. So, right off the bat, temperature anomalies began rising just after the year 1900 [1]. http://climate.nasa.gov...; /> As shown in the following chart [2], this corresponds closely with a recent rise in CO2 emissions. This chart shows that CO2 levels have always travelled in cycles, but broke their most recent scheduled downward cycle to reach their highest level in over 400,000 years. In a sense, one might say nature did half the work on CO2 and the human race took it from there. http://climate.nasa.gov...; /> Correllation is obviously not causation, but the mechanics that link CO2 to temperature have been well documented. Atmospheric Greenhouse Effects: A Review [3] CO2 does not deflect visible light, which is what originally makes it to the earth's surface. Upon reaching the earth's surface, visible light is partially absorbed by the earth or water, and partially reflected. The reflection process lowers its energy level, turning it into infrared light. CO2 deflects infrared light. So CO2's reflective properties for the earth are one-directional. Visible light pass downward unperturbed, but upward infrared is deflected downwards / sideways. This effectually increases the amount of light striking the surface of the planet, which at current greenhouse levels protects life from the freezing cold of space, and at future levels threatens to roast life - not to death, but to ecological disequilibrium. http://climate.nasa.gov...; /> Oceanic Greenhouse Effects: A Review The oceans currently absorb atmospheric CO2 and are undergoing a resulting drop in pH. They are also currently absorbing most of the extra heat from the sun, and therefore are experiencing a rise in temperature. Once they heat to a certain point, the oceans are expected to start releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere, which may include massive reserves that have been down there for millions of years. However, before the oceans can truly begin warming, the ice caps have to melt. http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu...; /> And as we can see here [4], though the ice caps have shown about a half-century lag behind the thinner, more responsive atmosphere, they are roughly 1 million square kilometers smaller than they ought to be, as of 2014. It appears that climate anomalies are closely associated with CO2 levels, that CO2 levels are primarily anthropogenic and will continue to be so until the next 'natural' CO2 spike roughly one hundred thousand years from now (chart 1), and that the greenhouse mechanisms behind all this are straightforward and established. 1. http://climate.nasa.gov... 2. http://climate.nasa.gov... 3. http://climate.nasa.gov... 4. http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu...",PRO,"Atmospheric Greenhouse Effects: A Review [3] CO2 does not deflect visible light, which is what originally makes it to the earth's surface. ... 1. http://climate.nasa.gov... 2. http://climate.nasa.gov... 3.",77

climate change,"To begin with, the definition of developed countries is incorrect. A developed country is a highly industrialized country. Your first contention states that developed countries are largely responsible for climate change. However, this is a broad generalization. Many of the countries that contribute to climate change are still developing because of their large debts. Also, there is a generalization that every country release a significant amount of of CO2. My opponent's case focuses on global warming rather that climate change. My opponent is ignoring that climate change is also caused by uncontrollable changes in our orbit around the sun and solar emissions. My opponent's second argument is that Developed countries are the only one's with capabilities to act on climate change. However, most Developed Countries do have a large national debt. We need to focus on the country's success before fixing the world. His last contention states that the greatest impact will come from when the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses make reductions. However, again this is a huge generalization. Not all developed countries release a signifigant amount of CO2 or even can afford to mitigate the effects of climate change. Your example of the US is irrevlevant. The United States cannot afford to cut back on the use of nonrenewable resources. You provide solutions that are inconvenient. For example, what if you live far from work, or couldn't afford organic foods. My opponent states that cooling the ocean floor only costs $14 billion. However most countries, with a massive debt cannot afford this. For example, take my previous argument that Norway is in a national debt of $644.5 billion. Shouldn't the country try to fix itself before fixing the world? The Norway example does not support the Pro argument. He states that it is more of a reason mitigate the effects of climate change. However, isn't it more of a reason to fix ourselves before the world. My opponent conceptualizes the view of how to mitigate the effects of climate change without providing a valid solution. Obviously $14 billion is not cheap and we should not invest in the world when our own country has economic issues that are not caused by Climate Change.

With so much information available, it can be hard to determine what knowledge is true or false. Misinformation tends to be centered around controversial topics that have false evidence or include ideological ideals. One rapidly growing topic is climate change. Many people believe that climate change is a hoax due to ""ideological and/or financial reasons,""(Citation 1). It should be noted that political views usually dominate one side or the other. Carbon emissions have been accelerating since the start of the industrial revolution. This is resulting in: global temperature rising, polar ice caps melting, and rapid environmental changes.

Then he proceeds to produce false information which has been specifically designed to trick and fool people into believing in climate change. My opponent also suggests that if the climate changes that it will pose a threat to humanity. This is false information as well. This is because the Earth is like a thermostat which self regulates itself. Thus, if you add extra heat to the Earth, then, this will create more cloud which will then cool the Earth back down to an even average temperature. 1.

I hope that in the future -- when I am a more developed debater -- I may challenge him again. As for my correlation of CO2 to warming, I must stand strong with it. I am aware that it was not the largest factor, but this correlation rate will continue to drop as the ppm of Carbon Dioxide rises, as it is an inverse equality. This is not me conceding the fact that there is a correlation, but that as our world becomes more laden with CO2, each molecule will have less and less of an effect. 1. Global Warming is real and is a threat I do not believe in Global Warming, as it means to show that the whole planet is warming (which I do not believe), but I understand the general use of the term now, even in ways to describe climate change. I believe that there is a vast change in our climate, and will continue to be as such. Perhaps now our data is biased on both sides, pro- or con-climate change. 2. Caused by humans I am well aware of the natural cycles of warming in Earth's geological history. Never before have we experienced such a sharp upward clime of Carbonppm without a natural calamity (such as eruptions, meteor collisions, etc.). To refute Con's claims on the 2,000-3,000ppm pf Carbon 60mya, I will use the same data as in my round 3. I used data from 66mya, 60mya, and 58mya, just to make sure I had all my bases covered, in case of his 60mya figure being an estimate. My attempted refute on your round2 source 7 was based on the grounds that our methods of measuring have become more efficient and accurate, so the data could be deemed inaccurate today (only a speculation). 3. Fixing the problem We are not ready to drop non-renewable fossil fuels. The profit is greater, and the amount of energy produced from these fuels far exceeds renewable energy. Hopefully, that can change. If not for a hopefully cleaner planet, then simply for the fact that we are going to run out one day. However, we will continue to grow in our ability to produce cheaper sustainable energy.

Here are my facts which I hope can put matters into perspective: A)Dinosaurs that roamed the Earth 250 million years ago knew a world with five times more carbon dioxide than is present on Earth today, researchers say, and new techniques for estimating the amount of carbon dioxide on prehistoric Earth may help scientists predict how Earth's climate may change in the future B) CO2 is not the only driver to climate change; atmospheric CO2 levels have reached spectacular values in the deep past, possibly topping over 5000 ppm in the late Ordovician around 440 million years ago. C) The global concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere "" the primary driver of recent climate change "" has reached 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time in recorded history, according to data from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. D) Solar activity also falls as you go further back. In the early Phanerozoic, solar output was about 4% less than current levels. The combined effect of sun and CO2 matches well with climate. E) I hope you can agree that the Sun is an independent system of the Earth. Therefore, whatever we do on earth do not affect the sun's activities. My Analysis of the situation: [A] means that the earth is capable of sustaining life and handling CO2 level that is 5 times more than what we have today. [B] & [C] support the CO2 level is 10 times more than now prior to the dinosaurs, which roughly supports [A] [D] supports that it is the combined effect of sun and CO2 that contributes to the climate change. You can see that even if we increase our current output, it would take a long time to create CO2 level that is 5 times more than what we have now. Even at that level, earth can sustain life like dinosaurs. Therefore, human activity does contribute to climate change in the time scale of a 100 year, but to put in into perspective, over the time scale that date back to the beginning of life, human contributed CO2 level doesn""t affect life all that much.

climate change,"There are so many things wrong with this theory of global warming that my opponent is pushing, I will go over them and in effect respond to all of the claims that my opponent made in the last round. THE MATH If 3.225% of CO2 emmissions are man-made, and 0.04% of the atmosphere is CO2, then man made global warming cxan only alter the global temparture by 0.000013%. In addition to this, CO2 is actually a very weak greenhouse gass. In fact, doubling the CO2 composition of the atmosphere would only increase the temparture by 0.6 degrees. {1} FEEDBACKS The theory was that an increase in the CO2 composition of the atmosphere increased, and if this increased the global temparture, then the ammoun of water vapor in the atmosphere would increase, which would reduce the global temparture as water vapor, or clouds, reflect sunlight back into outerspace. This is actually demonstrable, if it is raining outside, is the air colder or warmer? Colder, of course, whilst, if this theory of possitive feedbacks were true, the temparture should increase when it is raining outside. Water vapor reflects sunlight, and every degree of heat on this plaet comes from the sun, directly or indirectly. In addition to this, the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas diminishes as its composition of a given atmosphere increases. {2} THE TREND As I said before, we are in the middle of a natural trend where the global temparture has been increasing, my opponent claims that climate change is still man made because 'there is no evience this trend will decrease,' but that's just nonsense, the global temparture has been rising since before man made CO2 emmissions. The temparture has been rising since 1600. GLOBAL COOLING More ice= colder tempartures, if warmer tempartures created more ice, then people would put ice cubes in their oven to freeze them, not their freezer. This is just common sense- if Antartic Sea ice grows,m this means that the temparture has declined, claiming that tempartures have declined because of global warming is just completely absurd. My opponent cannot simply dissmiss newsmax because he think's they have a quote 'right bias,' is just an ad-hominid attack, my opponent has used primarily liberal sites but seems to think that these are not bias. Fact is, the global temparture is cooling because the sun has cycles of higher activity and warmer activity, creating natural global warming , which is now coming to an end as solar activity is declining. {3} {1}.http://notrickszone.com... {2}. https://wattsupwiththat.com... {3}. http://isthereglobalcooling.com...",CON,"GLOBAL COOLING More ice= colder tempartures, if warmer tempartures created more ice, then people would put ice cubes in their oven to freeze them, not their freezer. ...

climate change,"Thank You for a timely response, I will first go over my opponent's arguments, then go back to my own. First, my opponent talked about how many countries are in debt, and are not in the position to mitigate climate change. However, Global warming could cost the world up to $20 trillion over two decades for cleaner energy sources and do the most harm to people who can least afford to adapt, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warns in a new report.- USA today. Judge, 20 trillion dollars is the biggest number in this debate, and you have to look to our side for this argument. Not only that, but my second argument clearly talks about how mitigating the effects of climate change can increase jobs in the renewable energy field. Obsviously, since the benefits outweigh the harms, developed countries should have the moral obligation to mitigate climate change. Their second argument was that developing countries are the countries who wil suffer the worst and the have a huge incentive. However, my opponent is misunderstanding that point. This is about whether these countries should have a MORAL obligation, and as the pollution of CO2 emmissions from these developing countries are going to be pushed to the devloped countries, we have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the average atmospheric temperature rose by about 1 degree Fahrenheit. By 2000, that increase was responsible for the annual loss of about 160,000 lives and the loss of 5.5 million years of healthy life, according to estimates by the World Health Organization. The toll is expected to double to about 300,000 lives by 2020. Judge, if my opponent can prove that the developed countries don't have a moral obligation to save so many lives, and if he can show the justification of the deaths of so many people because of climate change, then they should win. If he cannot, you have to vote for the pro. My opponents last argument was essentially that developing countries are the ones with the better ideas. However, my opponent gives not evidence or examples backing this claim up, so it should be disregared. Now, to my side. First, I want to go over that adaptation is still an option. Adapting is always an idea. Vaccines which can save 9 million lives is a significant way to adapt, which will lessen the impacts of climate change, therefore mitigating the effects of climate change. Second, global warming can cause harms to the economy, such as a price tag of 1.9 trillion dollars each year by 2100. Mitigating the effects will enable us to avoid this number, and create more money and jobs. Third, my switching to renewable energy, we can stop sending money to terrorist groups, greatly decreasing their proft. Fourth, the enviornment can be greatly saved, saving millions of human lives as well as near extinct species.",PRO,"Judge, if my opponent can prove that the developed countries don't have a moral obligation to save so many lives, and if he can show the justification of the deaths of so many people because of climate change, then they",112
climate change,"I did not respond to your arguments because you didn’t make any arguments. What you did is make a bunch of assertions which you failed to support with reasons or evidence. However, since you seem eager to have address your arguments, I'll give it a go. Green Guilt CON has claimed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses propaganda in order to create green guilt. This is simply a bald assertion; I’m not sure what evidence CON has to support this claim, but I am interested to see it. As an intergovernmental organization, the IPCC is not tied down to the politics of a particular nation or religion, and its reports do not prescribe policy [1]. Again, I am interested to see CON’s evidence. Eugenicists CON has claimed that the term “global warming” is used by “modern eugenicists.” I’m not sure that there are any significant numbers of eugenicists around these days, but if they are I am saddened that they are trying to hijack the phrase referring to this great threat. I actually don’t know how to respond to this because CON has again failed to provide any evidence; either for the existence of actual groups of eugenicists or to their goals related to their use of the term in question. However, even if CON’s claim is true, it has no bearing on the veracity of global warming. Globalist Elite Finally, CON has made the claim that believers in anthropogenic global warming are being manipulated by the “globalist elite,” whoever that is. First, I would like to point out that, again, CON has made claims that he has not backed up with evidence. However, I would like to make the point that those who believe in global warming are following the evidence [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. CON is also claiming that these alleged “elite” are trying to manipulate global population to make it more closely resemble themselves. Perhaps CON provide some arguments and evidence in support of this claim as well. Final Thoughts The instigator of this debate has provided very little in the way of supporting arguments, and has failed to provide ANY evidence whatsoever for his claims. Instead, he has made numerous bald assertions. I am interested to see the arguments along with supporting evidence CON will provide in the next round.

climate change,"Hello, I thank you for going for this topic a go and giving an in-depth analysis of the topic given Before I go point by point, I will re-crystalize my case for better understanding. Let us go to the motion. By definition ""Developed countries have to support developing countries in the fight for climate change"" now the key words here is ""have to"" which is morally obligated to help these undeveloped countries . Now why I oppose this motion is that why are developed countries obligated to help underdeveloped countries while they are both fighting the same climate change with the same causes. I agree that we have to change our economic world for better chances to fight climate change, but most countries can""t afford the technology as you and I said. But the reason why I said developed countries can""t help them is for the following reasons: (I won""t regurgitate my old points but I""ll brush on them briefly) As I said the foreign aid given to these undeveloped countries have been improving but it is not improving the country that is receiving it therefore the foreign aid will go to waste even if they go to the right places since people can properly manage the foreign aid on their own. Secondly, as I said more developed countries cannot support the underdeveloped countries in a bigger scale since they have bigger things to deal with, while the underdeveloped countries have smaller problems compared to developed countries. But if you consider the underdeveloped countries problems they are pretty huge in their perception like the poverty in the Philippines, it""s a small country but it""s a big problem over there so just like developed countries have big problems, underdeveloped countries have bigger problems since they are most probably poor while facing a problem like climate change that is a very expensive problem that is draining their economy. So these countries rely on foreign aid since they are already in a bad position in their economy and instead of money going to the fight of climate change it""s now going to different places instead. Therefore while developed countries can help them, they shouldn""t be obligated to the underdeveloped countries. It""s an obligation to the entire Earth to help preserve it. It is my responsibility, your responsibility and many others responsibility to help prevent it. That""s why I believe they shouldn""t be obligated to countries but to be obligated to the further future generations of humanity and to Mother Nature that helps humanity everyday.

Once you reach it's saturation point of around 80 parts per million you get very little and a rapid decrease in any further reflection of the infra red spectrum. The earth is not like a greenhouse. The Earth is more like a thermostat. It transfers hot and cold air. A greenhouse doesn't transfer hot and cold air. Thus, A thermostat is a self regulating system which maintains an even temperature. A greenhouse is an enclosed space which doesn't allow air to circulate and the space becomes hotter than what the exterior environment is. This all assuming that a hotter planet would be a bad place to live in which is another false assumption. Note- A hotter climate would be beneficial to all living plants and animals. Whereas a cooler climate would be a disaster because less sunlight and lower temperatures mean less shelter and food for all plants and animals.

Now onto the rest. Science is highly unreliable when in the climate sphere. Back in the 70s virtually every scientist agreed that we were going into a massive ice age, and now they have flip flopped and now think the globe is warming. Science has been doing this forever, one weakly supported claim is said so much that it basically becomes fact. Also, reliable science shows that we are coming out of a minor ige age. So this warming trend it natural. Also, the climate is constantly changing, and it has been doing so since it was formed billions of years ago. For us to think that it is controllable or that we caused it is completely unethical. My whole point is that science argues more against climate change then for it, and it's not that hard to understand, its really common sense. Also, I understand that ice is melting and sea levels are rising. But a recent study shows that while arctic sea ice is melting antarctic sea ice is expanding. Another study shows that the sea level rise rate has decreased. And your comment to the pope is completely irrational.

As the negative, I will rebut the affirmative as to why CO2 emissions (whilst adding to the heat of the planet) are not directly responsible for the changes we are experiencing on our Earth today. The affirmative stated statistics such as- 'CO2 is the largest factor of global warming', '97% of scientists agree global warming is man-made', 'CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threat'. Whilst these points may be tried and tested, they do not favour the topic when the phrase 'directly responsible' is included.

Whilst this may be true, in between the lines of this statement we can discover that another factor is actually CAUSING the process of global warming.

Second, why do undeveloped countries need or depend on the help of developed countries and the UN? It is because of their economic vulnerability. Climate change will hit underdeveloped countries the most because of their economic vulnerability. And this is what makes these countries dependant on foreign aid since they can't afford it themselves which leads to lack of funding on better alternatives and better technology.

First I would like to define 'factory farming', being defined as ""a system of rearing livestock using highly intensive methods, by which poultry, pigs, or cattle are confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions."" 'Man made' implies that ""made or caused by human beings (as opposed to occurring or being made naturally)."" This means that the burning of fossil fuels, while it could occur naturally, occurs 'man made' as the method by which fossil fuels are creating climate change and are by all means man made, as to say that a majority of emissions would not occur, was it not for the human action of burning fossil fuels, thus implying a man made action and resulting in man made climate change.

There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements.

Con has provided no evidence to support that it is made in Massachusetts, or how the location of the dictionary company proves that it is unreliable. Until Con proves this connection, my definition of Feminism still stands. Yet I will make it even more difficult for Con. Here are many more authoritative definitions of Feminism: Oxford Dictionary - ""The advocacy of women's rights on the ground of equality of the sexes"" [3] Cambridge Dictionary - ""The belief that women should be allowed the same rights, power, and opportunities as men"" [4] Macmillan Dictionary - ""The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men"" [5] Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - ""The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men"" [6] Collins English Dictionary - ""A doctrine or movement that advocates equal rights for women"" [7] Dictionary.com - ""The doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men"" [8] For Con to prove that the definition of Feminism is not about equality, Con must prove that each and every one of the dictionaries above is an unreliable source. If Con cannot, then this debate must concede that Feminism is about equality between men and women by definition. I suggest an alternative viewpoint: A) Feminism is about the equality between men and women, as defined in all the sources above. B) Anyone seeking to gain more than equality is not practicing Feminism (as per the definition) C) There are people who falsely use the Feminism banner to attempt to gain more than equality D) Those who falsely use the Feminism banner should be condemned E) True Feminism (gender equality) is an ideal and should be supported As I mentioned in Round 2, I support equality between men and women.

feminism,"You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. Um... No, that's not what feminism is at all. Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]"". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define ""the patriarchy"". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about ""calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure"". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that ""false rape reports"" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.",PRO,"You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad.

feminism,"As per the rules of the debate as set by my opponent, this will be my final argument. Since my opponent has failed to formulate a response, I see little need to elaborate much on my previous post. I will merely offer a brief summary of my arguments and this debate as a whole. My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don't consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically concedes the debate by stating ""in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city."" Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let's ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me this debate.

But since I was confused, I am taking back the first stance I made and am taking the side of Radical feminism (the movement that does these things you mentioned such as ""main spreading"" and ""hepeating""). Radical feminism is a movement whose main focus and objective is to challenge oppressive systems within society. This is incredibly important, as this revolutionary idea is what the United States government is based upon.

feminism,"Hi everyone I'm Ilan and I am not a feminist. Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a ""sexist"" or ""a rape apologist"" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no if ands and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is ""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities."" and that for feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."". Now that we have established some ground I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, be whatever the hell that you want, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality.

Now that I start to think about it, I don't really have a BoP, since my opponent is the one claiming that something (feminism) has a particular characteristic (sexist). Nonetheless, I will do my best to provide good reasons to reject the assertion that feminism is sexist. Reminder: Definition of feminism as stated by my opponent: '[Feminism is] The advocacy [or support thereof] of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes"" Definition of sexism as stated by my opponent: ""[Sexism is] Prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.""

According to the definition of feminism, it does not; feminism advocates equal rights between men and women. Experience (as well as reason) as thought us that a society in which everyone possesses equal rights is better of than one where that isn't the case.

Stereotype: Definition: 'A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism use stereotypes on the basis of sex? According to the definition of feminism, it does not; advocating equality between men and women is actually a good way to ELIMINATE stereotypes, which historically have been mostly directed at women (a few examples: http://www.businessinsider.com...). Therefore, one can not say that feminism is using stereotypes on the basis of sex. Discrimination: Definition: 'The unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism advocate the use of discrimination on the basis of sex? Again, according to the definition of feminism, it does not; advocating equal rights is a good way to make sure that we live in a JUST system. Feminism actually seeks to eliminate the idea that men and women are 'different categories of people'. (I have already covered prejudice). Therefore, one can not say that feminism advocates the use of discrimination on the basis of sex.

Because of feminism, women have gone from having no place in the workforce to complete legal equality to men. Just a century ago, women could not even vote. Look at us now. It is possible that a woman will be the President of the United States in just a few short months. Despite what your opinion of Hillary Clinton is, you must admit this could be a major step for American history. Unfortunately though, women in certain other countries do not have equality to their male counterparts. Many middle eastern countries with Sharia-based laws are no where near the gender equality level of America. In some regards to marriage, women have much less of a say on who they can and cannot marry than men. Sharia law basically restricts a Muslim woman from marrying a non-Muslim man. This does not apply to Muslim men. Under Sharia law, if a women wants a divorce from her husband, his consent is required. However, if a man wishes to divorce his wife, he simply has to say ""talaq"" (I divorce you) three times. Above all else, in my opinion, one of the most sickening parts of Sharia law has to do with restrictions on a woman who has been sexually assaulted. If a man rapes a woman, under Sharia law, she could be forced to marry him. All these reasons and many more are why feminism is still needed today.

Feminism is what women want to make sure they are treated equally as everyone else, however, they use Feminism as a tool to provide them with certain rights that no one else can have. These include inflated pay, etc., [3]. With this new breed of Feminism we have just created a group of misogynistic women who prefer double standards to men. In addition to this, there are some women who face unnecessary backlash from Feminists. These women are those who would prefer to stay at home with their children, who like being subservient to their husbands and who enjoy doing domestic work. Feminism is a doctrine that advocates equal rights for women. It no longer advocates equal rights for women but more tries to create a double standard and give them more of an ""edge"". Therefore it is devoid of its original point, therefore it is pointless. I don't really care one way or another about Feminism, I just found it an interesting topic.

It's really a non-issue because we aren't going to force people into fields they don't want to do. We definitely aren't going to artificially inflate other fields for the sake of equity.

But there is one tiny thing in feminism that in itself is not wrong: Men and women having equal rights and oppertunities. The only thing is that the men's side of it is often ignored. But the fact that over the centuries women have been treated as nothing more than objects and property of men to be disposed of at any time gives them a reason to feel victimized. It is easier for men to be against feminism because over the years society has favored, respected and raised them to idols while women were crushed down, oppressed, disrespected and treated as nothing more than baby machines.

feminism,"Feminism is defined as ""the advocacy of women's rights in the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men."" So many people still wonder why we need feminism, why any woman in this day and age would call herself a feminist. The word itself has become a dirty word. Instead of seeing it as something good, the idea of feminism has been warped and shaped into something cruel and oppressive, something that supports abortion on demand. Feminists are seen as man haters and women who want to take over and eliminate men. Many still ask the question ""Well why do you still need feminism? Women have the right to vote, go to school, own property, etc."" We need feminism because if someone never told them they were wrong, men would always treat women as objects, like a subordinate, like property. Feminism is the fight against this. But that's over now, right? That's no longer necessary? We fought our war, but now we are done, right? Men have not evolved from their original nature. Men have not surpassed and outgrown their feeling of superiority over women. Every single thing a woman does is sexualized. Girls are sent home from school for wearing yoga pants because ""It's distracting to the boys."" Fifty year old men will cat call 12 year old girls on the street. Girls are taught to walk down the street with their key between their fingers in case they are attacked. In cases of rape, women are asked, ""Well what were you wearing?"" We are told ""You must have been asking for it."" Girls are taught to cover themselves up instead of teaching boys not to rape. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, ""In 2014, female full-time workers made only 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a gender wage gape of 21 percent.""

CONSAD agrees [13]; the Bureau of Labor Statistics agrees [14]; the Joint Economic Committee agrees [15]; the Government Accountability Office agrees [16]. And really? Someone created it to divide people?

Which sounds great and all but modern day feminism, in my opinion, is just something used to give women an advantage and antagonize men. When I ask most modern feminist, ""name one thing a male can do but you can't"" they can't say anything because there really isn't. (At least in the U.S.) If anything men have a disadvantage nowadays. I will list a few -Men pay 97% of Alimony -Men lose custody in 84% of divorces. -77% of homicide victims are men. -89% of men will be the victim of at least one violent crime. -Men are over twice as victimised by strangers as women. -Men are 165% more likely to be convicted than women. -Men get 63% longer sentences than women for the same crime. -Court bias against men is at least 6 times bigger than racial bias. -Males are discriminated against in school and University. -Boys face vastly more corporal punishment than girls. -60-80% of the homeless are men. -At least 10% of fathers are victims of paternity fraud. -One-third of all fathers in the USA have lost custody of children, most are expected to pay for this. -40-70% of domestic violence is against men, however, less than 1% of domestic violence shelter spaces are for men. -Men pay over 70% of income tax but the vast majority of public spending is on services for women All these statements come from a website called http://www.realsexism.com... . This website compiles all sources from various places which support each of my examples. I have looked through all of them myself. For example in my first example about alimony, the U.S. census bureau found that only 3% of men received alimony in 2010. Now if you ask me that sounds like an awful amount of disturbing disadvantages. Which you don't hear feminists talk about or protest about. But what you do hear is them talking about the wage gap. Which has actually been debunked, I could explain later if you want. So my point is that modern-day feminism is just a load of bull. As all they focus on is benefiting women.

feminism,"Thanks Pro for the timely response. Definition Problems There is a problem with Pro's definition of ""requisite""... it defines ""requisite"" as a noun, while the word ""necessary"" is used as an adjective in the debate resolution. We know this because when one diagrams the sentence ""Feminism is necessary"", the word ""necessary"" describes ""feminism"" and is therefore an adjective.[3] With this in mind, Pro's definition of a noun isn't interchangeable with the adjective ""necessary"". In other words, Pro's argument concerning the definition of ""necessary"" should be disregarded. Logical Fallacy Pro has engaged in a logical fallacy known as ""Moving the Goalposts"". I doubt if she did it on purpose, but regardless of her motivation, her argument should be disregarded nonetheless. Let me explain: Moving the goalposts: ""Moving the goalposts, similar to ""shifting sands"" and also known as raising the bar, is an informal fallacy in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded. That is, after an attempt has been made to score a goal, the goalposts are moved to exclude the attempt. The problem with changing the rules of the game is that the meaning of the end result is changed, too."" [4] Basically, once I showed feminism is NOT necessary, Pro tried to change the resolution from Feminism is Necessary to ""Feminism is Necessary for the achievement of a specific end"". That's unfair. If Pro wanted to debate that, she should have said so before I accepted the debate. It's too late to change the debate now, so I ask the voters to ignore her attempt to do so.

feminism,"I would like to thank my opponent for her opening arguments. At this time, since it wasn't defined in the first or second round by my opponent, I would like to offer a definition of the word ""necessary"". Necessary: being essential, indispensable, or requisite [1] This is a common definition, so I presume Pro will have no problem with it. Now for a little history of feminism: ""Charles Fourier, a Utopian Socialist and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word ""f""minisme"" in 1837.[10] The words ""f""minisme"" (""feminisme"") and ""f""minist"" (""feminist"") first appeared in France and the Netherlands in 1872,[11] Great Britain in the 1890s, and the United States in 1910,[12][13] and the Oxford English Dictionary lists 1852 as the year of the first appearance of ""feminist""[14] and 1895 for ""feminism"".[15]"" [2] So, with this in mind, I think I can address all of my opponent's arguments with one general rebuttal: Since there was once a time when feminism didn't exist, it's clearly not necessary. It's not essential for our survival, nor is it indispensable, or a requisite. Feminism may or may not be a good thing to have, but it's NOT necessary. We have lived without it in the past, and could do so in the future. Remember, we're NOT debating if we SHOULD practice feminism. The debate resolution is about whether it's necessary.

A status which grants me an “essential” status in our species that men can never have and which can never be taken away from me even in old age.' This is a load of rubbish, I mean, it takes two people to make a baby, hence the male and female are both 'essential'. Also, I would like to point out that the vast majority of woman are paid less than men in the same job, some employers won't hire women in case they become pregnant and have to take maternity leave and there are still a large range of stereotypes against women.

I believe both men and women deserve equal rights and oppertunities in this world, but I think feminism has gone a little bit too far nowadays.

If you're fighting for equality, you would fight to say that men are permitted to keep their power in government and in the workforce as well as women. But on the other hand, I cannot deny that there are feminists who actually do fight for equality. I am not attacking all feminists because I know there are some well meaning ones out there and I appreciate that they are trying to battle the inequalities women AND men nowadays. But I just don't think there is any need for feminism anymore. It started back when women had very little working rights and were only seen as housewives and mothers and obviously they wanted more than just that. But nowadays, women have the choice to stay at home or work. What need is there for feminism? The point is that feminism has gone past the point of acheiving equal rights for men and women.

feminism,"Thanks again, Pro, for your response and thanks for creating this debate. It's definitely been interesting. Having said that, I did have a few concerns regarding your last argument. Let me explain: Dropped Argument Last round I very directly said that my opponent's definition of ""requisite"" should be disregarded. I said this because she was using the definition of a noun, and the word ""necessary"" is used as an adjective in the debate resolution ""Feminism is necessary"". Because of this, I said, Pro's definition/argument should be disregarded. So, with that in mind, what was my opponent's response???? NOTHING. She didn't even ATTEMPT to discredit my argument. By being silent, I can only presume she did so because she was not able to refute my argument. As captain of the debate team, it seems rather unlikely that she just forgot to respond. After all, with only 2,000 characters per round, it's not a very long debate. I encourage the voters to see her drop for what it is, an admission of guilt. What We're Debating Again, my opponent seems to be trying to change the debate as we go along. She brings up many reasons why we should like feminism, but when reading them, ask yourself ""Is this what they were supposed to be debating?"" I would argue the answer is no. For example... Do we have to have a ""fully functional, fair society""? No. Do we have to ""live cohesively""? No. Do people have to have ""a sense of self-worth and identity""? No. Certainly all those things are nice, but we don't have to have them, therefore, feminism is NOT necessary. Straw Man Argument My opponent has engaged in another logical fallacy. This one is known as a straw man argument. This is done when someone misrepresents her opponent's arguments. [5] I never said that the age of something determined it's worth. What I said was that we can tell something is NOT necessary if we can live without it. Even if that something is helpful, if we can go on without it, it's NOT necessary. That's exactly what we see with feminism. Feminism may or not be beneficial, but that's NOT what we're debating. We're debating if it's necessary, and since we could (and have) lived life without it... It's not necessary. No Semantics Here I used generally accepted definitions from a reliable dictionary. Conclusion I think the choice is clear. I showed that feminism is NOT necessary. After I did that, Pro tried to change what we were debating in order to salvage her chances of winning.

feminism,"By definition feminism is: ""the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes."" So in other words, feminism is believing women should have equal rights as men. To this definition, I agree wholeheartedly. Men and women should have equal rights (to an extent - maternity leave etc). However, the current 'feminism' movement across the western world (or at least NA) doesn't follow the true meaning of the word. Modern 'feminists' are mostly SJWs trying to raise women above, and to push down men. Most women polled across the states don't even label themselves as feminists anymore because of these radical 'feminists'. These 'feminists' constantly attack men, get triggered by things trivial and are unable to see where rights are balanced. I disagree with you that true feminism isn't needed anymore in the US, for there are still a few instances where women are at a disadvantage to men. The pay gap is a myth, yet there is still sexism, and sexual harassment of women: which I do NOT support. In these ways feminism is still needed.

feminism,"Well, first of all You have to understand, that feminism, misandry and matriarchy are three very different things. Matriarchy is identical to patriarchy, with the exception that the roles are reversed and the woman is the authority figure, feminism does NOT support that. Misandry is the expression of hatred towards the male gender, feminism does NOT support that, either. Feminism strikes to correct some very obvious and toxic treatments and social beliefs towards women until they are equal to men. It is very simple. The reason why this movement was named 'feminism' is that women are considered to be mistreated more in comparison to men. It is much like racism towards black people. Misandry does exist, but it does not hurt men socially or politically. While misogyny has caused not only the mistreatment of women but also the lives of women. Admittedly, there are people who call themselves 'feminists' in order to excuse their sexist actions, but this percentage is very minor and the whole movement should not be brought down because of the mistakes of minor. Feminism is needed for plenty of reasons. It is a problem that in rape, the woman gets hate for being too 'provoking' or wearing inappropriate clothes. No is no! Women don't say no and they mean yes, they say no because that's their answer. Feminism also benefits men. Society treats men like they are animals, it's their 'hormones' they say, 'they can't help but think of sex' or the most irritating phrase 'boys will be boys"". This actually underestimates men's intelligence. Such words allude that men only seek sex and are willing to commit rape for it.

feminism,"I find the maxim ""All people, regardless of gender, race, age, sexuality, should be held equal under law"" to be worth ignoring. Under the law men and women are generally equal, so this maxim is irrelevant. I was trying to think of examples most feminists bring up as an argument towards this. One example is gender pay gap. The ever-changing wage gap has many fallisices (see this source: http://dft.ba...). The point here is that there is barely any wage inequality. But by focusing their outrage into a tidy, misleading statistic, feminists have become jaded. In the source, she brings up that after mixing in different variables, a women makes 91 cents to a man, even then there are other undiscussed variables like maternity leave among others. Plus I am not sure 9 cents is something to throw a hissy fit over. Now I will move on to ""a feminist is not feminism"". I am not mixing them, but rather doing the opposite. I clearly said I was talking about radical feminism. Because by going with regular feminists who just want equality for all sexes, it's hard to think who disagrees with that. The basis of feminism is almost unarguable from my point of view, because I want equality for both sexes. That is why I am going by the radical feminist point of view, because that is something I strongly disagree with.

Feminism makes the claim that there is a hierarchy that exists that is tilted in favor of men, this is called patriarchy. Feminism means to abolish this social hierarchy in favor of gender equality between the sexes, not the supremacy of one sex. This alone is clarified in the definition of the term, and anyone who strays from this term (such as radical 'feminists' like TERFs) is by definition not a feminist, nor do they under any circumstance represent feminism. Saying such is equivalent to me saying, since one person in the state of Louisiana is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, then all people in Louisiana are members of the Ku Klux Klan. Saying that all feminists seek to harm men is baseless. Purporting that feminism ignores issues like domestic violence against men, or non-recognition of female on male rape (both of which are issues that MRAs like to throw around, but do nothing about) is also baseless.

feminism,"Good day, reader! As you can see, this debate is about how Humanism is a better and overall more morally just ideology then Feminism. I make this claim considering myself as a humanist and someone who particularly doesn't like the modern-day feminist actions or some of their ideals. I constantly find myself while arguing with them to say this or something along these lines: ""So, you think that men need to be taught not to rape? How about, not teach ANYONE to rape? Both genders can rape. All races can rape. All sexual orientations can rape. It's not that defined in males. Don't you think it would be a better alternative to explain why rape is morally unjust to EVERYONE? So everyone can then understand that?"" Because that's how I honestly think about it. Humanism is an ideology I think that is more fitting, but also because in Humanism, skeptical inquiry and criticism are beyond welcome. Feminism seems to just let a lot fly as long as it goes under the banner of feminism. Just this morning I saw a debate that said ""Men accused of rape should be castrated."" Not even proven to have raped, just ACCUSED. That's just making whoever is accused guilty until proven innocent and, need I mention that is a harsh punishment? I feel its sad I have to show why this is wrong, but while we're at it lets make the death penalty for people ACCUSED of murder. Moving on. I won't go in deep, but that is my general claim. Humanism is a better ideology to possess then Feminism because it has an open mind, it is open to free criticism, in Feminism most people I've seen who oppose the movement are instantly labeled misogynists, and it covers the philosophies and issues of all races, genders and sexual orientations out there. It tries to say that humanity is equal, and we need to put aside our differences and realize that all of us individually have our own prejudices for whoever we are. And instead of placing the blame on others, we need to place the blame on ourselves and be responsible, striving to teach and educate on why in the vast and strange reality we live in, we at least need to accept each other.

Since I was not descriptive enough in my opener I will now try to be more specific. I do not advocate the inequality between a males and females. I admire forms of feminism that are against genuine abuse, disempowerment, and exploitation. Western feminism in my opinion seems to be shrouded in a passive-aggressive ""all bark no bite"" resentment that criticizes women for embracing their femininity, disdains them for using their sexuality and bullies them into feeling weak and oppressed for choosing to be housewives, caretakers and full time mothers. I have found myself despising the majority of this movement because it is filled with hypocrisy and only see what they want to see. I have been in debates where common sense and logic was useless with them. Feminists state that men and women are identical when it comes down to the brain, but many feminists also support LGBT (transexuals specifically). This itself is contradictory because a transexual emotionally and psychologically feels that they belong to the opposite sex, but how can you support this, and support the opinion that men and women are identical, and that society has made them different? I feel as if feminists are fueled by their hatred of white men. Many females at my college are feminists and tbh feminism has ruined relationships I have had with people.

feminism,"""If the anti racism movement were about equality, it would be called equalism."" ""If the disability rights community wanted equality, it would be called equalism."" ""If gay rights activists wanted equality, they would call themselves equalists."" Can you see how vapid those sound? Yes, those activists want equality at the core, but the name of their activism (gay rights, disability rights, anti racism, feminism) tell specifically which group they fight for. Feminism is an ideology of women's injustices being dissolved. So here's the main biggies on why feminism is relevant: Slut shaming: a woman who sucks off four guys at a party is ridiculed and seen as disrespecting herself, whereas a guy who gets sucked off by four girls get respect by default. Sex is assumed to be for the pleasure of a man. Male sexual desire is considred normal, whereas a girl's is taboo, naughty, filthy. This world needs to know that nothing is wrong with being a slut, and that it doesn't negate intelligence or worthiness of respect. Hyperattractivization - Beauty is considered the main aspect of a woman's worth. While an actor can be ugly (like Danny DeVito) and still be popular and respected, female actresses tend to be selected for their attractiveness toward straight men and are always made to be prettied-up. Media outlets comment on women's looks, but not on men's. Living in the Las Vegas metro area, I've seen billboards for male attorneys making them look respectable and typical (and it's okay if they're ugly or old), but billboards for female attorneys put a bunch of makeup and stylish-looking skirts and high heels on them, putting them in stereotypically attractive poses. Despite Hillary Clinton's high-profile achievements, articles still spring up about her clothes and hari--never happens to her male equivalents. Female Supreme Court justices are called ugly hags--never happens to their male equivalents. I've found that my attractiveness speaks louder than my voice, and while it's not considered weird for a ""hot"" guy to be also smart, it strikes people quite oddly when they see me (conventionally attractive) getting high academic achievement awards and having a higher IQ than that of Einstein. That's why I feel we need feminism. Women aren't viewed equally. Their gender is considered a defining, categorizing aspect, not just another ancillary aspect such as height or eye color. Saying that feminism is female supremacism just because of the title is as facile as assuming Libertarians are fetishists of the Statue of Liberty.",PRO,"Yes, those activists want equality at the core, but the name of their activism (gay rights, disability rights, anti racism, feminism) tell specifically which group they fight for. ...

I could successful still school my opponent arguing “Feminism is selfish” but I’m not going to make that a goal of any kind, I accepted a debate challenge knowing nothing other than the resolution was “Feminism is used against Men” and I expect and demand to keep your honor by sticking to the resolution of the challenge that YOU issued Pro. So for anyone to vote for Pro in arguments he must prove the resolution that “Feminism is used against Men” not because of any arguments he makes that it is “selfish”. I have no problems with your definition “a collection of movements to raise the equality between men and women” so we can press on from there Domestic Violence: Domestic Violence is a non-relevant issue to what feminism is or is not used against. Domestic Violence is caused by people being evil, not by human movements. Feminism does not cause it and it certainly does not promote it. Pregnancy: Uh, the man already had his choice when he chose to have sex with her. He doesn’t want a kid than he shouldn’t a planted his seed. That’s really case closed to that argument. Child Support/Welfare: This is not an issue of feminism either it is an issue of justice and responsibility, if you have a child you should support it in someway, its called “manning up and being a man” if you’re a man like me. No human activist movements change that fact. Child Custody: Your source with the statistics on child abuse percentages is fascinating. Although it does not help your case. Of course they are going to be higher for women there are more homes with women in them because fatherless homes are becoming a huge problem. And the factors going into this problem are not feminism but rather what I would attribute the extended age of adolescence that is showing up in young men, forcing younger women to grow up faster. http://www.joshuakennon.com... http://www.thedailybeast.com... Circumcision: Circumcision is a religious right of Jewish family’s and has nothing to do with sexism. At the best you could start a debate over details to consent involved in this to ageism (disregard of the concerns of youth and prejudices toward youth) as we grow up adults get to make our “consenting” decisions for us for quite awhile and we do not start to truly get the legal status to grant our own consent until we are about 16 years old.

feminism,"I have three main arguments against feminism: it's sexist, it makes sexism a dialectic problem when it is not, and it states that the feminine image is bad and that women should avoid it. Feminism is sexism This is the first and most significant argument. Sexism is discriminating by gender. As far as I'm concerned, that's what feminism does. Feminism is always fighting for the women's right but never for the men's. This is indeed discriminating men by its gender. Also, they state that all men are bad, and violent, and dominant, and oppressive, and so on, and so on, just for being men. Again, this is a way of sexism. Even the name is sexist. Feminism, that doesn't sounds like a movement looking for equity. And indeed, feminism is a one way movement. It only cares for women. I understand that women were more discriminated throughout history than men. Nevertheless, this isn't a valid argument to support discrimination towards men. What we really need is equity. Sexism isn't dialectic Feminists describe the sexism problem as dialect. They think of this problem as a war between men and women. However it is not like that. First, the relationship between men and women shouldn't be seen as a war. We need to dialogue and debate in order to achieve equity. Fighting isn't the way civilized people should act. Secondly, there's more than men and women in this problem. The gender spectrum is in this days better described, and thus more complex. There's not just men and women any more. There are transgenders, gays, lesbians, and more others. It is simplistic to describe sexism as men vs women. But again, this is another way to attack men. Feminine image is bad Another negative point of feminism is the systematic attack to the image of a woman being gentle, delicate, ""feminine"". They attack the women who are men dependant, who are housewives, and all what conforms the stereotype of women. I don't believe that all women should follow the stereotype. But also, I believe that women must have the opportunity to choose what they want. If they want to follow the stereotype, let them do it. If they want to be different, let them too. It's a matter of free will. However, feminists oppose to this and state that following the stereotype is wrong, and propose another way of being. Summarizing, what feminist do is limit the free will of women, making them change from one stereotype to another. As you can see, feminism is a movement which has negative effects to society. We must promote a movement of gender equity, one which ensures the protections of every gender's rights.",PRO,"I have three main arguments against feminism: it's sexist, it makes sexism a dialectic problem when it is not, and it states that the feminine image is bad and that women should avoid",205

Humanism: An outlook or system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize common human needs, and seek solely rational ways of solving human problems. Feminism: The advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. The ideology of humanism covers all human matters. It protects men, women, animals, our planet, our technology, our sciences, the actions we humans do, and so much more. Feminism claims to be for equality, but if they were for equality, why is it that Feminists and the M.R.A. (Men's Rights Movement) are so opposed to each other?

feminism,"Basic Definitions: Feminism is a collection of movements and ideologies aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, and social rights for women.[1][2] This includes seeking to establish equal opportunities for women in education and employment.(1) feminism: noun 1. the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men. 2. an organized movement for the attainment of such rights for women(2). Organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests.(3) More detailed description & variety: Feminist activists campaign for women's rights – such as in contract law, property, and voting – while also promoting bodily integrity, autonomy, and reproductive rights for women. Feminist campaigns have changed societies, particularly in the West, by achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, equal pay for women, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property.[7][8] Feminists have worked to protect women and girls from domestic violence, sexual harassment, and sexual assault.[9][10][11] They have also advocated for workplace rights, including maternity leave, and against forms of discrimination against women.[7][8][12]Feminism is mainly focused on women's issues, but because feminism seeks gender equality,bell hooks, among other feminists, has argued that men's liberation is a necessary part of feminism, and that men are also harmed by sexism and gender roles.[13] (1) Feminism is both an intellectual commitment and a political movement that seeks justice for women and the end of sexism in all forms. However, there are many different kinds of feminism. Feminists disagree about what sexism consists in, and what exactly ought to be done about it; they disagree about what it means to be a woman or a man and what social and political implications gender has or should have. Nonetheless, motivated by the quest for social justice, feminist inquiry provides a wide range of perspectives on social, cultural, economic, and political phenomena. Important topics for feminist theory and politics include: the body, class and work, disability, the family, globalization, human rights, popular culture, race and racism, reproduction, science, the self, sex work, human trafficking, and sexuality.

Thus this motion must fall."" First if all, the purpose of feminism is not to put women on par with men. This is not true. Feminism is simply about equality of opportunity and treatment. The right to be treated as equals, and the right to have the same opportunity. You are right that a minute amount of women are in positions of power, the figure is estimated at 20%, but don't jump to conclusions, this does not mean that there is inequality. 73% of the people in medical and healthcare related jobs are women. Does that mean there is male sexism within that field? A survey conducted shows 76% of public school teachers were female. So is there inequality there? Is that what it proves? Because it is ignorant to think true equality means everything is 50:50. The floor will agree that if 15.7% of people in the American Army are women, it doesn't mean sexism. After all, that would imply that exactly the same amount or a majority of women actually applied and were turned down. If there were more men applying, of course more men will be in the army. Of course men, who have a better suited anatomy for the work of the army will be admitted.

feminism,"Feminism today is obviously a rising topic/issue/problem/whatever you'd like to call it, but nonetheless you can't argue that it isn't out there and isn't a big idea. Feminism has been on the rise in recent years, but that doesn't mean it only just became an ideology. For instance, when WWI/WWII were happening and growing into a global conflict, it called for more of America's men to step forward and serve their country. Naturally, this calling opened up a lot of needed positions in the States because now our warehouse workers, truck drivers, office workers, and just about anything else you think of were out across the world fighting for the USA. Women decided to step up and take a stand back home, no longer voices and now wanting to become real parts of society from what they were (housewives, stay-at-home moms, cooks, etc.) This was not a bad thing at all, in fact I think this benefited America in numerous ways, bringing in the equality factor, and also now that women were taking over jobs previously held by a man, I think the drive to be a harder worker and more competition for these jobs now by both men AND women sets the tone for the United States citizen's hardworking, get-s***-done spirit. Nowadays, feminist rallies and rising tensions between women supporting feminism (in my opinion) has drastically, drastically changed. No longer do I see a lot of ""equality"" or ""equal pay"" or anything along those lines - in the news and on social media I see constantly, women in support of ""feminism"" is now about having women become the superior. Women need better pay then men. Women should be running large companies, not men. Women should have the big-shot jobs, not men.

feminism,"my opponent has forfeited once again. I will simply reiterate what i said earlier. Feminism does not have a focus on equality. This is mainly derived from the women-centric advocacy. To advocate for women's rights, but not do the same for men, is to increase the rights that women have. The areas that i mentioned (Selective Service/Voting, Domestic Violence, and Rape) are areas wherein women have been given protections, or rights, that were not extended to men. For men, voting is not a right, it is a privilege. Men are liable to be arrested and convicted of a felony, should they not sign up for Selective Service.

Domestic Violence law is not based upon the fact that a partner is being abusice. Rather, the Duluth Model, from which the VAWA was made, assumes that men are the perpetrator. It should be said that, by virtue of the aforementioned clause of the definition of feminism, this should not be the case. Abusive relationships should not be tolerated, regardless of the gender of the victim. The fact that men are more capable of damaging their partner is not a viable excuse to ONLY punish men. Legally, it is not possible for a woman to rape a man. The definition of rape requires penetration; consent is not a part of the legal definition of rape. Rape is only a punishible crime when a man is the perpetrator. The gender of the victim is irrelevant. The issue lies in the fact that ""consent"" is a mind-state.

feminism,"Definition and focus: I would like to focus this debate to a subsect of feminists, those that Christina Hoff Sommers referred to as 'Gender feminists'. Considering the unpopularity of being called a feminist, many have tried to expand the definition of feminism to include nearly anything a woman does to her advantage. This is not to debate the libertarian strain of 'Equity Feminist', as I do not believe they are Marxist. Moving forward, I will use 'feminist' to mean 'gender feminist'. Argument: The purpose of the initial post was to instigate a response to a well known document in feminist circles. Ms. Hanisch clearly espouses collective action and tries in her paper to expand the 'class' by including women who felt they were removed from her Marxist based movement. She identifies two groups of feminist: The first are women who are in 'therapy'. The second are the Marxist who are trying to affect political change. This second group, she clearly admits it's roots in Marxism: ""Recognizing the need to fight male supremacy as a movement instead of blaming the individual woman for her oppression was where the Pro-Woman Line came in. It challenged the old anti-woman line that used spiritual, psychological, metaphysical, and pseudo-historical explanations for women's oppression with a real, materialist analysis for why women do what we do. (By materialist, I mean in the Marxist materialist (based in reality) sense, not in the ""desire for consumer goods"" sense.) Taking the position that ""women are messed over, not messed up"" took the focus off individual struggle and put it on group or class struggle, exposing the necessity for an independent WLM to deal with male supremacy."" But,you are correct, one person makes not a movement. Feminism (American brand), is based on class struggle. It assumes men and women are the same. All differences are attributed to oppression by the patriarchy. In this, feminism argues that we are not a product of our biology and environment but rather purely by the environment. By assuming that men and women are the same, they come to the conclusion that the differences that exist are due to personal (and as Ms. Hanisch describes, this means it is political) oppression by the patriarchy. Consider these areas of interest to feminists in the economic area: Universal healthcare Affirmitive action Paid daycare Equality of Outcomes, not the Equality of opportunity If one is a capitalist then one would allow the free market to determine prices, supply and demand.

feminism,"I am glad to take this debate. Thank you for the opportunity, and good luck. Firstly, I would like to address feminism in a way which is comprehensive, so I will begin with some opening arguments. (1) Feminism was a movement launched with the intent of ending stigmas women faced. (1a) During the great depression in America, women faced harsh gender biases when attempting to find work. Women who attempted to attain employment, economic success, or even self-dependence, were often accused of thievery and stealing opportunities from their male counterparts. According to the article, ""Women And The Great Depression"" by Susan Ware, """"Women who sought relief or paid employment risked public scorn or worse for supposedly taking jobs and money away from more deserving men."" The previous quote does in fact prove that women faced stigmas exclusive to them, and thus those stigmas gave them difficulty when trying to find employment. This therefore proves the need for feminism. (1b) Feminism has accomplished many many things for the sake of women; ranging from reducing gender pay inequities, granting women the right to the suffrage, allowing them to wear clothes, participate in the entertainment industry, and even has allowed them to serve in government positions. According to an article by the History Network, ""For almost 100 years, women (and men) had been fighting to win that right [suffrage]: They had made speeches, signed petitions, marched in parades and argued over and over again that women, like men, deserved all of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship."" Again, this is evidence that feminism, a movement which was initiated to advocate for the escalation of women's statuses in society to be equal to men's, does in fact benefit women. (1c) The very definition of feminism is also proof that feminism operates predominately in the interest of women who face gender stigmas, however, it does also operate in favor of both: ""1 : the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes 2 : organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests"" Sources Cited: (1a) https://www.gilderlehrman.org...

feminism,"Although we are at odds over the nature of feminism, we both agree that an ultimate goal of equality between the sexes is paramount and deplore the rise of misandry amongst so-called feminists. To conclude, then. Feminism is indeed about women. It is about the affirmation that women are not inferior to men; that women should be equal to men. My opponent has narrowed his definition of feminists from the sum total of feminists to Western feminists; and then from Western feminists to 'the majority of feminist organizations, academic feminists, and feminist media'. It is unsurprising that examination of this subset of feminists reveals misandry; few would undertake a dedicated career in feminism without passion, and thus a tendency to radicalism or even extremism; this is hardly an unbiased strata. This, however, does not apply to all feminists; as my previous statistics revealed, the majority of women who consider themselves feminist support their own gender in claiming equality as opposed to inferiority. They do not support misandry. An overwhelmingly female society of course cannot support or equally represent men. This is because it is not intended to. Feminism counteracts misogyny; Masculism counteracts misandry. Feminism is as much about gender equality as Masculism, and vice versa; both are movements intended to counterbalance inequality based on gender. Anyone can be both Masculist and Feminist. The reason that single-gender organisations can be genuinely essential, however, are twofold. First, emotional support. No matter how sympathetic the parties involved are, there are some experiences that simply do not cross genders well. Especially with sexual issues, there is real discomfort involved. This is why it is possible to request a male or female doctor; or a male or female counsellor. Then as well, few women understand on an instinctive level the stigmas, demands and assumptions the male psyche labours under; the reverse is also true. Second, self-representation. To combat inequality, to organise a response representative of those suffering that inequality affirms the purpose of those doing so; in effect, to say, 'We are doing this ourselves because we are capable of doing so.' Failure to do this has undermined many causes. The empowerment of a gender involves demonstrating that it's members do not require the other gender to oversee their political movements. Closing remarks, then. Feminism counters female oppression; Masculism counters male oppression. A society can suffer from both; indeed, both are present in varying doses in Western society. This does not make the individual gender movements any less valid. Feminism is and remains a movement intended to restore balance where inequality for women exists; the presence of misandry and inequality for men does not violate it's validity or necessity.",CON,"This is because it is not intended to. ...

feminism,"The injustices that the women of the Middle East and parts of Africa currently suffer are not that different from that which women historically endured in the west. These feminist movements outside the West are just beginning and are merely in their First-wave Feminism phase, thus they are pure in their egalitarian pursuits. My augment however is that Western Feminism has evolved far beyond these budding movements from the goal of gender equality to exclusively female advocacy. Hence the motion: ""Feminism in NO LONGER about gender equality"". Western Feminism not only fails to be equal to men, but it also fails its sisters suffering outside of the West. ""Feminists are tied up in knots by multiculturalism and find it very hard to pass judgment on non-Western cultures. They are far more comfortable finding fault with American society for minor inequities (the exclusion of women from the Augusta National Golf Club, the ""underrepresentation"" of women on faculties of engineering) than criticizing heinous practices beyond our shores. The occasional feminist scholar who takes the women's movement to task for neglecting the plight of foreigners is ignored or ruled out of order. Take psychology professor Phyllis Chesler. She has been a tireless and eloquent champion of the rights of women for more than four decades. Unlike her tongue-tied colleagues in the academy, she does not hesitate to speak out against Muslim mistreatment of women. In a recent book, The Death of Feminism, she attributes the feminist establishment's unwillingness to take on Islamic sexism to its support of ""an isolationist and America-blaming position."" [...] The sisterhood has rewarded her with excommunication. A 2006 profile in the Village Voice reports that, among academic feminists, ""Chesler arouses the vitriol reserved for traitors."" ""The Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF) has been intelligently fighting the mistreatment of women in the Muslim world for several years. In 1997, in a heroic effort to expose the crimes of the Taliban, [...] created a vital national campaign complete with rallies, petitions, and fundraisers. The FMF, working with human rights groups, helped to persuade the United States and the United Nations to deny formal recognition to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. It helped convince the oil company UNOCAL not to build a pipeline across Afghanistan, and it brought the oppression of women living under radical Islamic law into clear relief for all the world to see."" ""It was a good example of what can be achieved when a women's group seriously seeks to address the mistreatment of women outside the United States.""

abortion,"Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by the removal or forcing out from the womb of a fetus or embryo before it is able to survive on its own. An abortion can occur spontaneously, in which case it is often called a miscarriage. It can also be purposely caused in which case it is known as an induced abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy. The similar procedure after the fetus may be able to survive on its own is medically known as a late termination of pregnancy. There are two kinds of abortion in the U.S. "" in-clinic abortion and the abortion pill. Abortions are very common. In fact, 3 out of 10 women in the U.S. have an abortion by the time they are 45 years old. If you are pregnant, you have options. If you are trying to decide if abortion is the right choice for you, you probably have many things to think about. Learning the facts about abortion may help you in making your decision. You may also want to learn more about parenting and adoption. If you are under 18, your state may require one or both of your parents to give permission for your abortion or be told of your decision prior to the abortion. However, in most states you can ask a judge to excuse you from these requirements. Learn more about parental consent for abortion. Only you can decide what is best for you. But we are here to help. A staff member at your local Planned Parenthood health center can discuss abortion and all of your options with you and help you find the services you need. The debate over whether or not abortion should be a legal option continues to divide Americans. The abortion debate is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral and legal status of abortion. The two main groups involved in the abortion debate are the self-described ""pro-choice"" movement (emphasizing the right of women to choose whether to abort a pregnancy or to grow it to term) and the self-described ""pro-life"" movement (emphasizing the right of the embryo or fetus to gestate and be born). Both of these ascriptions are considered loaded terms in mainstream media where terms such as ""abortion rights"" or ""anti-abortion"" are generally preferred. Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position, with small numbers of anti-abortion advocates sometimes using violence.

Often countries allow abortions only in special cases, like rape, fetal defects and maternal health. Only 6 countries refuse to give abortions under any circumstance. However, many countries allow abortions for any reason. “The landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, decided on Jan. 22, 1973 in favor of abortion rights, remains the law of the land. The 7-2 decision stated that the Constitution gives ‘a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy,’ and that ‘This right of privacy... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.’ ” Abortion in many countries is considered a civil right and taking away a right is not a good thing.

Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries. Though this is a form of abortion, I argue that it should in no way be supported. 4. Dangerous abortions I am against many forms of abortion for health reasons. The use of coat hangers to stimulate an abortion, for example. Or throwing oneself off a flight of stairs. Or going to a back-alley abortionist that doubles as a tattoo parlor.

According to Birth Mothers (an organization working to help women with unwanted pregnancies), one of the most commonly used types of abortion is a saline abortion. In a saline abortion, amniotic fluid is removed from the woman and replaced by a strong saline (salt) solution. As the fetus""s lungs absorb the salt solution, it begins to suffocate. It may struggle and may even have convulsions. The saline also burns off the fetus"" outer layer of skin. Saline abortion can take one to six hours before the fetus is no longer viable. According to Life Site News, 1,200 babies survive abortions each year. About 50% of them die before the age of 12. For those who do not die, mostly all of them have a disability or lifelong impairment. This act is cruel to those babies who survive the abortion. According to Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life (an pro-life organization), babies can feel pain from abortion. Neonatologists and nurses are able to see unborn babies at 20 weeks gestation react physically to outside stimuli such as sound, light and touch. The sense of touch is so acute that even a single human hair drawn across an unborn baby's palm causes the baby to make a fist. This clearly proves that a baby can feel pain from abortion. Sadness surfaces when thinking of this fact. Cruelty is a word used in many different scenarios, most often used when discussing murder. Abortion is murder; therefore, abortion cruel. What is a woman thinking when she is deciding to have an abortion? Did she think, before sexual intercourse, about the possibility that she may get pregnant? According to Operation Rescue, 87% of women who have had an abortion admitted that they were thinking only of their pleasure when they were not using proper protection or birth control during sexual intercourse.

In my opinion it is ultimately up to the women who is pregnant to choose whether she has an abortion or not.

By this I mean who would decide whether the parents, in particular the mother, are choosing abortion because they don't want the responsibility. Would a doctor have to review the current state of their lives and make a decision for every person who wanted an abortion? That just doesn't seem fair or practical. One other argument I will draw attention to (which I think you would agree on) is that young teenage girls who become pregnant are more likely to die in pregnancy than women over the age of 17-18, the babies born to these younger mothers are also at greater risk.

For nine long months, a woman would be forced to be reminded daily of the day they were raped. Poor women may not be able to provide a suitable environment for children. If a woman is denied an abortion, she is more likely to become unemployed, live below the poverty line, and depend of public welfare. Modern day abortion is very safe. Women actually have a much higher chance of dying from childbirth, than having an abortion.

That one exception is when the mother is guaranteed to die during child birth or if both the fetus and the mother will die during child birth.

abortion,"I thank Con for his response, and after a review of his 2nd round, I see no compelling reason to justify the illegality of abortion considering the issue of maternal death. Con opens with a justification for the illegality of abortion by citing post abortion depression. As support, Con links an article from the American Spectator by an author who champions pro life positions. Mr. Allot has many articles supporting his anti abortion stance in a variety of conservative news publicans. I would love to see the study he references, but he does not provide a source. Some anti abortion sites list the report in the same vague terms as Mr. Allot, but they do not link it or give me any information so I can examine it myself. These sites seem to be echo chambers. At this point I cannot consider Mr. Allot's reference to the report credible. In addition, the New England Journal of Medicine contends that much of the information concerning post abortion depression is not supported by scientific research. http://www.nejm.org... And will serve to disrupt the doctor/patient relationship. Even if Con and Mr. Allot can show that abortion may result in post abortion depression, neither addresses the situation that is the basis for my position – maternal death. I need only show one case where an abortion is less risky than a full term pregnancy. I can. Just this year peer reviewed research as shown that abortion is much less risky than childbirth. Here is the Reuters article. http://www.reuters.com... And you can see the journal is linked at the bottom so you can at least read the abstract or check out the issue at the library. http://journals.lww.com... In light of peer reviewed research, I submit that an abortion, in general, is much safer than childbirth in some cases; therefore, Pro's contention concerning post abortion depression is not supported. Con's contentions concerning maternal death rates: Con agrees that complications occur during pregnancy and supports equal access to healthcare – we can agree here but he does wish to note that women referenced in the Amnesty article want to have a baby. I cannot see this distinction, nor do I find it relevant so I see no need to discuss it until Con can show why it is important Adoption: Adoption may be a valid option for some women, but doesn't address the issue at hand (maternal death). Adoption may be a better choice for some mothers, but in light of the current situation concerning the mortality rate in childbirth; it certainly isn't the best choice for everyone.

abortion,"I would like to open by stating that I personally do believe life begins at conception and do not agree with abortion being used as a contraception of convenience. However, there are many reasons why abortion should not be made illegal or considered wrong in all circumstances. Abortion for the sake of the mother's health to me seems a simple decision, if the birth of the infant will result in the death of the mother and the child, then how can it be justified to let them both die? Clearly here an abortion is necessary in order to prevent the death of the mother. Secondly abortion where a pregnancy is the result of a crime like rape, incest, or child abuse. No human being should be forced to carry a child for 9 months and then give birth to it, if its conception is the result of such physical and mental trauma. This to me would be a form of mental torture almost unparalleled. Thirdly an abortion where the child of the pregnancy would have an ' unacceptable quality of life' such as cases where the child would have serious physical handicaps, serious genetic problems, serious mental defects. And finally a few other reasons to consider are: poverty, the mother unable to cope with a child (or another child), and the mother being too young to cope with a child. These are all legitimate reasons in favour of abortion. Now to quote you ""Did these innocent lives choose abortion?"" the answer is no, of course. However, an equally plausible question is ""Did these innocent lives choose to be conceived?"" the answer is again, no. The foetus has no choice in its conception or its birth. It lives or dies off the choices of the mother who carries it, and ultimately the decisions must come down to her. By taking away the right of abortion, we take away the right of a woman to choose and this along with the other points I have stated have no place in a modern, secular and equal society.",PRO,"I would like to open by stating that I personally do believe life begins at conception and do not agree with abortion being used as a contraception of convenience.  ...

abortion,"I am going to start with one of my favorite quotes from Mother Teresa ""The greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion because it's the direct killing of the innocent child by the mother herself; and if we can accept that a mother can murder even own child, how can we tell others not to kill one another."" Abortion will always be an injustificable act of murder. No infant nor unborn child should be denied from her right of life. I totally agree with Mother Teresa that abortion is an act of murder by the mother. Why is it wrong to kill another person if they are allowing abortion. In 1973 the U.S. Court legalized abortion. In the next source you can see about how many women have had abortion. Thus would equal to the amount of murder since 1990, imagine how many innocent lives have been taken. Many people try to justify abortions. For example, rape victims believe their case is justified, but the truth is that by having an abortion you are punishing an innocent unborn child which you could of found a nice family for him to be adopted. By having the abortion you are taking the life of a little person that is growing inside you; when the one you should be punishing is the person who commited that horrible act of rape. Another reason in which they think is justificable is when they are under 18, but the truth is that most of this young girls brought that on them selves. They were having sex unprotected when they shouldn't been having sex. They are just taking the easy way out instead of taking responsability for their act I will end this par of my argument with stating the legal principal that says ""innocent until proven guilty.""

abortion,"I'm sorry to hear that. But my point is, you're not taking a child's life away because they never had one to begin with. They were never conscious of their self, and by having an abortion it's as if they didn't exist. And I would argue that abandoning them is more inhumane than abortion, even if you consider abortion morally wrong. First of all, let me stress that if people don't want a baby, they will find away to get rid of it. If abortion is illegal, some of them will turn to infanticide, which is truly wrong because they are actually killing someone, unlike abortion. I stated it before, but infanticide rates dropped once abortion became legal. And if they don't kill the baby, their alternative is to simply abandon it. I think we can agree that no child should have to be brought up like this, living their childhood in an orphanage without ever meeting their real parents. And those abandoned children? They will likely turn out to be future criminals. Some may become rapists, impregnating women with a child they don't want in a vicious cycle. In a way, I like to think of abortion as a milder form of euthanasia. Like euthanasia, abortion helps end future suffering but we must keep in mind that it is a fetus, not a human being and therefore not akin to murder. We wouldn't call a seed a tree, so we shouldn't consider an embryo a human. For a final closing statement, let me emphasize a simple yet overlooked fact: Let a mother decide what is best for her child. You wouldn't tell a stranger's children what bedtime they should have. That should be up to the parents to decide. Likewise, we should let the mother decide whether she is ready to have a child or not. If a woman is having an abortion, she has a good reason to and we can't infringe on her right to get one.

abortion,"There are many good and bad sides to abortion, But just like everything, There is no black and white, Just a whole range of gray. Abortion is one way that poverty can decrease. Most unplanned teen pregnancies that lead to child birth, Lead to either the child being sent to adoption, Or the family being sent into poverty. That is because raising a child is expensive and some parents are just not mature enough. I would not want to live in a world where children are living their entire sad lives in poverty instead of less children living in more richness. Abortion also has its consequences. The parents who get an abortion are usually called out by their friends for killing their own child. That alone is enough to discourage abortion for most. That leads us to the ethical values of abortion. Even though abortion is logical in every way, The rules of ethics say that killing an unborn child is bad because it is like killing a child. Just like how Thanos (from Avengers: Infinity War) wanted to kill half the universe so that the other half can live a life filled with happiness, Abortion prevents entire families from going broke and allows them to have children later in life that can live a rich life.

Response to Pro's arguments Your main argument is that abortion would prevent a child from living a life that could be miserable. However, in what world do we have the right to murder people against their will if we subjectively deem their lives not worth living? With your logic, we would be perfectly justified in walking into an orphanage and killing all the orphans. You say that abortion would reduce child abuse, but that""s replacing one evil with another. Since when do we kill people to prevent them from being abused? Furthermore, the majority of orphans to do not suffer child abuse; so if abortion was encouraged instead of adoption then the majority of orphans would be murdered despite them not actually suffering abuse at all. Why should the majority be killed in order to reduce the suffering of the minority? ""17,900,000 will never fin a home , would you want that for a kid?"" A childhood in an orphanage is a lot better than no childhood (and adulthood) at all. Even if we deem that it is not, why should we have the authority to deny these human beings the chance in life? We don""t see many suicidal orphans, which is surely testament to the fact that a childhood in an orphanage is preferable to death. ""What's better putting a kid threw that ? Or doing what is best for the parent and child."" Abortion =/= doing what is best for the parent and child. Why? Because killing the child is not doing what's best for it.

abortion,"Laws have never stopped abortions, Or even reduced them. Reports from the UnitedNations and the GuttmacherInstitute have found that abortion rates are higher in developing countries where abortionis illegal, Compared to rates in developed countries where abortion is legal. In other words, Restrictive abortion laws are not associated with a low abortion rate, And result in high numbers of unsafe abortion. In countries where abortion is widely available including Canada where there has typically been a decline in abortion rates over time because of increased contraception use. You contradict your self when you say "" In the case of the woman's life being in danger, Abortion makes sense. "" As I have said every pregnancy carries some risk of serious complication or death. Being pregnant should not take away a person's right to choose. Most anti-abortionists confidently state as ""scientific fact"" that human life begins at conceptionand therefore embryos deserve legal protection. The question of when life begins is a philosophical issue, Not a scientific one, And there can be no consensus. The moral value of a fetus is also a matter of personal opinion, So it must be left up to individual women to decide what their fetus means to them, If anything. But even people who believe abortion is murder often need abortions, So the nature of the fetus and its moral status are ultimately beside the point. Many people talk of balancing"" the rights of the woman with the fetus. But it is impossible for two beings in the same body to both enjoy rights. But the physical unity of a woman and her fetus precludes the imposition of a duty of care on her, Because that would be a profound compromise of her privacy and autonomy. Legal precedents over the last 20 years have more firmly established not only the full rights of pregnant women, But the necessary lack of fetal rights. The Criminal Code says that a fetus does not become a human being until it has completely exited the birth canal, Alive. This definition has withstood the test of time and several legal challenges brought by anti-abortionists. You are confusing the facts, Abortion is not the problem it is a symptom of a greater problem that is not being addressed. Answer me this, Why do women not want their babies.

abortion,"I thank my opponent for accepting this debate and would like to wish him the very best of luck. Contention 1: A logical reason why abortion is wrong. I would like to begin with this quote: ""To prevent birth is anticipated murder; it makes little difference whether one destroys a life already born or does away with it in its nascent stage. The one who will be a man is already one."" Tertullian (160 - 220) 1. Murdering a human is wrong 2. Abortion is murder 3. Therefore, abortion is wrong Assertion 1: Murdering a human is wrong Most sane people would agree with this assertion. Assertion 2: Abortion is murder By definition, murder is the unlawful killing of another human being. We need to determine why the fetus should be under this protection. Evidence 1: A fetus can dream Many pro-abortion activists say that a fetus cannot think. However, we have discovered that they can, in fact, dream. Therefore, the fetus must be conscious. I encourage any pro-choice activists to read the article Baby's First Dreams following this link http://www.sciencedaily.com...; Evidence 2: A fetus, by definition, is a human! Many pro-choice activists argue that the fetus is not a ""human"" until it is born. Let me ask you this question, what makes a human fetus any different than a dog fetus? Is the dog fetus not a ""dog"" because it is smaller or because it is not yet born? No. Then what makes human fetuses different? Furthermore, whether you agree with that argument, I want to ask you and any pro-choice activists this question: ""Why isn't a fetus a 'human?'""

Abortion is one of those issues that has no straight forward solution that is applicable to ever occurrence. In either scenarios of rape or a child being brought into a world with less of a chance to succeed in life, there are no winners. Each case is unique and should not be looked upon the same in the eyes of the law. For those who wish to use abortion as a scapegoat or as a means or birth control to avoid their responsibilities I believe shouldn't be granted the right to an abortion. Coming to the conclusion that that child will indefinitely not succeed in life is a generalization that bounds no lawful or moral right to an abortion. I believe that cases that deal with rape or incest are an exception but, should be handled in a timely manner and not put off till whenever the female carrier feels that she is ready.

abortion,"Many believe that a baby is a gift from God and that everyone has a purpose in life. If we destroy a life, we are acting against the creator of the world, God. For those that don't believe in the Bible, there is a difference between life and death. Death is the termination of the heartbeat. The heart is formed by the 18th day the baby was formed in the womb and the earliest time for a woman to get a medication abortion is 10 weeks-70 days-after the woman's latest period. For an aspiration abortion, the woman should be up to 12 weeks far in her pregnancy. Both of these procedures have side effects. The medication abortion will cause the woman to have cramps and heavy bleeding. Aspiration abortion side effects include cramping, nausea, sweating, and feeling faint. There is a 10% chance of minor complications to occur and it includes possible heavy or prolong bleeding, blood clots, infections, damage to the cervix and perforation of the uterus. Therefore, killing the fetus is murder if the heartbeat has ended. If the heartbeat was used to define life then nearly all abortions would be outlawed. Also during the abortion, the baby will feel sensations around its face and mouth as well as a needle stick and draw back.

Even those who believe that abortion is ethical feel it would be preferable not to have an unwanted pregnancy in the first place.

Cultural biases towards male children are often internalised by women. It makes sense that both mothers and fathers would be concerned about who will care for them in old age – not just men. Men and women from the same socio-economic and cultural background are also likely to have similar ethical views and therefore are unlikely to disagree on their ethical standpoint on abortion.

Whilst there is a greater prevalence of abortions of female babies, there are a lot of abortions of male babies as well. Assuming that abortion does cause women a lot of distress, this harm will not be removed by encouraging parents to have girls because they will continue to abort male foetuses.

I am not quite sure whose information is correct, but acccording to Life News, more women die from abortion vs. childbirth. Here is a link that I found with a wonderful graph showing these rates. http://www.lifenews.com... You are absolubtely right that there are many pregnancies that end in misscariage. I saw on Pregnancy Life that 10% of pregnancies do end in miscarriage. But, what happens to the other 90%? Do they just die? When you are talking about it being the mother's choice, do you think it is okay for a woman to have an abortion during the second or third trimester? Why or why not? According to Glen Beck news, 67% of people believe it is okay for a person to have an abortion during the first trimester. Then, when asked if it is okay to have an abortion during the second or third trimester, only 15% said that it was okay. If it is really the woman's choice and if you claim to be pro-choice, don't you think the woman should be able to have an abortion at any stage during the pregnancy. Then we get into the extreme case of, well, if a woman is allowed to have an abortion during pregnancy, don't you think the woman should be able to kill her child after it is born? You know, since it is ""her choice..."" Let me ask you, do you think that it is okay to kill a child one minute before birth? Well, you argue that it isn't a human, it is a fetus. Is there a difference in the baby one minute before birth or one minute after birth? It is completely phycostic to say that it is not a human when it is the same thing, separated by the lining of a placenta. - That is a strong argument when discussing abortion, but there is already tons of back street abortion occuring now. But, this honestly dwindles down to natural selection. A woman may go into a back street abortion knowing what she is doing, just like she knows she is going to have unprotected sex before concenption of the baby. The issue is that most women know the risks at hand when going into these types of dangerous abortions. Should the child die because of this? And with suicidal women carrying child, this unfortunately occurs now and I do not know how that relates to our argument of abortion. - I basically would just like to ask; where are your moral values? Do you think a person should die in the place of another? I do respect your opinion. I can understand where you are coming from.

Abortion is in direct defiance of the commonly accepted idea of the sanctity of human life 2.

Adoption is a viable alternative to abortion and accomplishes the same result. And with 1.5 million American families wanting to adopt a child, there is no such thing as an unwanted child. 4. An abortion can result in medical complications later in life; the risk of ectopic pregnancies doubles, and the chance of a miscarriage and pelvic inflammatory disease also increases. 5.

Abortion punishes the unborn child who committed no crime; instead, it is the perpetrator who should be punished. 6. Abortion should not be used as another form of contraception. 7. For women who demand complete control of their body, control should include preventing the risk of unwanted pregnancy through the responsible use of contraception or, if that is not possible, through abstinence. 8. Many Americans who pay taxes are opposed to abortion, therefore it's morally wrong to use tax dollars to fund abortion. 9. Those who choose abortions are often minors or young women with insufficient life experience to understand fully what they are doing. Many have lifelong regrets afterwards. 10. Abortion frequently causes intense psychological pain and stress. You made some good points that a fetus is not truly a person I would disagree though. Although it is not fully grown it is a spark of life a life in the making. To destroy the fetuses opportunity to live is murder. As you were saying about how we kill animals all the time the only reason we do this is because that is the natural order. Humans are on the top of the food chain. We kill animals below us for food ( in less it is in the case of hunting for game which I am against), we eat animals to survive. But to kill one of our own species is not the natural order.

abortion,"Abortion involves terminating a pregnancy by the removing or expelling of a fetus or embryo from the uterus. This is sometimes due to the death of the fetus; however, it can also result in the death of it. Abortion is a very controversial topic because its frequency of occurrence, legal, cultural and religious status varies extensively in different regions of the world. There are many high-profile groups that champion either pro-choice or pro-life, and such organizations bring up a host of issues to further their often political agenda. In the United States, pro-life groups favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, or even the complete prohibition of it. They argue that a human fetus is a human being with a right to live, so abortion is similar to murder. In contrast, pro-choice groups argue that a woman has certain reproductive rights, especially the choice on whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. One of the most common reasons why some women want to have an abortion is because they have the desire to delay childbearing because they themselves are young. Other reasons include not wanting to stop work or schooling and/or because of financial or relationship instability. These reasons are consistent across numerous countries, including America. Most abortions that occur in the United States are obtained by women of a minority race because they are having higher incidences of unintended pregnancies. In developing countries, women have the additional concern of health risks and complications that occur as a result of unsafe practices in medical settings. Some abortions happen because of societal pressures. This occurs to when there is little social support, when a specific gender of a child is preferred or when governments enforce population control, such as China's one child policy. It is suggested that sex-selective abortion could account for disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. Many countries in Asia like China, South Korea and India have cultures that prefer male children. When abortion occurs because of societal pressures, women sometimes have to resort to unsafe practices because the legalized healthcare route is not an option. As a result, countries that have restrictive abortive laws have more women that seek unsafe abortions. Unsafe abortions occur when they are performed by individuals without adequate medical skills or in an unhygienic environment. Such situations occur globally, and result in about 70,000 maternal deaths and 5 million maternal disabilities per year. Currently, laws regarding abortion are diverse and differ by states in the U.S. Some states have a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion can be carried out and require that information regarding fetal development is given out. The abortion debate also focuses on whether laws should be passed mandating that the pregnant woman has the consent of others, especially if the woman is a minor.",CON,Other reasons include not wanting to stop work or schooling and/or because of financial or relationship instability. ...

""the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death."" so, the list: growth: yes reproduction: no, as it is not fully developed functional activity: no, as it must grow within the womb, and does not even move for a while continual changes after death: yes. so we can conclude that babies are about 50% the way to being ""life"". so technically, life does not begin at conception.

C1: Abortion is claiming many lives TFP Student Action ""Since the legalization of abortion in 1973, over 57 million unborn children have been killed, more than the entire population of Spain. That's 155 babies per hour. About 1 every 24 seconds."" Since Abortion is claiming many lives, this is bad for us because it is not morally correct to end a life. Furthermore, everyone has the right to live and have a chance in this world. Abortion immorally takes away the lives of many people, thus we must negate. A1: Abortion is morally incorrect Matt Slick I believe he said it best, as explained: ""The primary reason abortion is wrong is that God said that we are not to murder. But not all people believe what God says so let's look at it from a different angle. We are allowed to take life under the prescribed requirements of law such as self-defense, war, execution, etc. Each of these areas deals with Law. Self defense is justified because an antagonist is breaking the law (burglary, robbery, assault, etc.,), and we can use force to protect ourselves and our property. War is the legal declaration of hostilities towards another nation. Execution is the legal taking of life against someone who has committed a crime or crimes worthy of execution. In each case, the antagonists are dealt with for the wrongs they have committed. However, the baby in the womb has done no wrong, yet it is executed. It is executed but has broken no law! What crime has been committed? What law have they broken in their existence? None. Yet they are killed."" Thus, abortion is incorrect. The baby has done nothing wrong, and yet it gets punished by getting its life taken away from him/her. Negating abortion will allow for the babies that are being aborted get their morally inherent universal life that they are deserved.

The officials that dictate whether or not that individual should be granted the right to an abortion should be a medical professional. That individual would be taking all of the risk with their career and medical license on the line when dictating that decision. Simply basing an abortion on excuses such as, money, responsibility, or success in life are NOT legitimate reasons for an abortion. These are selfish justifications that dont excuse this individual from giving birth. Every human being brought on this earth has a chance to do what they wish with their life and for a person to automatically declare that their child wont have a good life and so shouldn't be brought into this Earth is an ridiculous statement.

T=0: Woman decides to get pregnant, and feels like she and her husband can support a child. T=3-6 months: Incident puts wife or husband out of work. Now here is abortion vs non-abortion Abortion Timeline: T=7 months: Wife aborts. Recovery is slow T=9-18 months: Recovery finishes, wife and husband happy. Non-abortion timeline: T=7 months: Recovery is slow T=9 months: Baby born, Recovery comes to a halt T=9-33 months: Mom and Dad and Child all have to work extremely hard to keep themselves alive. Abortion, while killing one person, protects the torture of two or three. ""Why can a mother harm her unborn baby for whichever reason she desires?""

""If the mom doesn't have the choice to kill the baby once he/she is born, why should it be any different a few weeks before?""

abortion,"Why do you think abortion is murder? Many would argue, including myself, that murder is the unlawful killing of another human. When we abort a pregnancy we do it within a time frame that the fetus cannot live outside the womb, it cannot feel pain, and cannot live outside the womb without the mother. I wouldn't constitute that as a human. Abortion is more than just ""I don't want to have a kid"" in most cases. The majority of women who get abortions do it for medical reasons or because they were raped. Do you think abortion is wrong, even if it risks the life of the mother? What if it risks the life of the mother and child? What if the mother were to have been raped and did not want the child of their rapist? Would it be wrong then? What if the child were to have ALS and doomed to have a life of suffering? Abortion is perfectly reasonable in these instances. The mother is already living and will continue to live with an abortion. If both child and mother are at risk. then it's much more reasonable to save the life of the mother, then let the mother die, and a potential child too. The mother should not have to have a reminder of what could possibly be the worst experience in her life, and I believe that it is morally wrong to damn a person to have a terminal disease, a very painful one, then to get an abortion. If your answer to these is that it is perfectly reasonable, but with proper documentation, I disagree.

""Abortion is a violation of human rights"" - This is a statement concerning law. o Burden of Proof - Is upon my opponent since he is the instigator. o Morality Dispelling Fetus - The womans body naturally dispels fetus. This is why babies are never born without major organs, since the woman miscarries long before the fetus is carried to term. Abortion is thus something that is routinely practiced by natural biological processes in nature. What is a fetus -In her book, On The Moral and Legal Status of Abortion, Mary Anne Warren - an American writer and philosophy professor that taught at San Francisco State University - details five psychological criteria for personhood. According to Warren, these qualities include consciousness and in particular sentience; the capacity to reason; self-motivated activity; the capacity to communicate messages; and lastly, the presence of self-concepts.Since a fetus does not possess any of the above qualities, it can rightfully not be considered a person. http://www.utilitarian.net... o Law -Can law prevent abortion Abortion is practiced even if its illegal.According to Planned Parenthood, ""In 1972 there were 1,000,000 illegal abortions and 5,000 to 10,000 women died from them."" When Roe v. Wade passed in 1973 (a year after the above-mentioned statistic), deaths from abortion drastically dropped. This is supported by the National Center for Health Statistics' own statistics.` -Consensus The government has no right to enforce an opinion on its people if most or even many people disagree.

abortion,"My opponent has forfeit. I will fulfill by BOP by providing three arguments against abortion. 1. Abortion is murder. The killing of an innocent human being is wrong, even if that human being has yet to be born. Unborn babies are considered human beings by the US government. The federal Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which was enacted ""to protect unborn children from assault and murder,"" states that under federal law, anybody intentionally killing or attempting to kill an unborn child should ""be punished... for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being."" The act also states that an unborn child is a ""member of the species homo sapiens."" [126] At least 38 states have passed similar fetal homicide laws.

abortion,"Thanks Pro for starting the debate and good luck. I apologize for the delay. I will be arguing against abortion. I hope that round 1 was not all of Pro's argument but all Pro seems to indicate that abortion is a right. I am unaware of such a right. Since pro did not make many arguments for abortion I will give a brief outline of arguments against abortion and I will try to incorporate some counterclaims as well. Life Begins at Conception It is a foregone conclusion that what is in a mother's stomach is a living being and not simply a body part of the woman's body. End of story. [1] Those who are pro-choice tend to avoid calling to murder by pointing out that since the baby isn't viable it is more justifiable. I am assuming pro is fine with pretty much all forms of abortion that take place because pro did not give any period of time. If we use what I just gave as a reference, babies can become viable sometimes as early as 22 weeks. [2] Even prior to that, why is there any justification for killing a living baby just because it cannot survive on its own? Plus if one were to just wait a few weeks, the baby will become viable. Proponents of abortion, especially those who consider it a right, tend to argue that since abortion is the deliberate termination of a baby in the womb, if the government would outlaw abortion they would be ""forcing"" women to have a baby which is unjust. This is blatantly false. The government is not ""forcing"" people to have babies by preventing the murder of them. The government is simply executing one of its primary roles which is to protect the life of people. The government has every right to prevent people from murdering each other. And guess what? A women has every right to not get pregnant. I look forward to your response. Sources: [1]: https://www.princeton.edu...

abortion,"The opponent stated that ""The unborn's not always gonna die"" however, abortion is ""the termination of pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo before viability""[1] . Therefore abortion is the death of an unborn child whether induced or spontaneous. 2. Not all women in all countries have access to safe abortions,"" Even in cases where abortion is legal, or legal in specific instances, women may still seek unsafe abortions. High costs, a lack of providers, deficiencies in equipment or an inability to demonstrate or meet the criteria needed to obtain the abortion may contribute to her decision to access an unsafe abortion.""[2] According to reproductiverights.org, every minute 40 women undergo an unsafe abortion, 10 of whom are girls between the ages of 15 and 19. My opponent asked how many people died per year from getting abortions, here is his answer,""Almost 80,000 women die each year due to unsafe abortion and millions more are seriously injured"" [2] which outweighs his estimate of 47,000 women dying from NOT getting one. It is evident that unsafe abortions are more likely to kill women, however ,""Of the estimated 42 million abortions that take place every year, only 22 million occur in a safe and legal environment"" [2] Therefore, due to the lack of equipment, medical facilities, money women, especially those in less developed countries are subjected everyday to unsafe abortions. In these countries even if abortion were to be legalized, women would still die from the lack of facilities available to properly carry out safe abortions. Now, imagine if they were legal.

abortion,"For the second round of this debate I will argue against the points you made and try to explain other legitimate pro abortion ideas that you may not have considered. Firstly I assume by a medical professional you mean the doctor performing the abortion? I think you are asking too much of a doctor to risk their career and medical license in making such a decision, I also feel they aren't really qualified to and that most doctors wouldn't want to make this decision (this is what I mean by it not being practical or fair). You also stated that ""Every human being brought on this earth has a chance to do what they wish with their life..."" If this is the case then shouldn't a mother have the right to choose to have an abortion? If the parents genuinely feel that they can't look after a child because they aren't ready or they can't afford it, then I don't think that its ridiculous for them to want an abortion. There would be nothing crueler than bringing a child into this world that isn't wanted. Surely it would be better to terminate the pregnancy in the early stages, than let the child be born and face neglect and parents who do not want him/her. I am disregarding the point you raised that abortions have only been around for ""100+ years"" as a good basis for a debate about fairness or practicality, there are plenty of things that have been invented in the last 100 years which have helped the human race incredibly. Also I don't think that you can use the fact that your mother and you would not have been born as a viable argument, the issue of abortion can not be brought down to a personal level (even if you think it has affected you/your family) and that seems to be what you are doing. I would also like to bring up the point that if abortion was restricted, like you wish it to be, then parents who felt they couldn't raise a child and thought abortion was the only way, would only end up turning to illegal abortions after being turned down by the doctor. This would more than likely end up in there being a lot more deaths caused by abortion, as well as the creation of a huge black market of doctors practices. I put forward the idea that if you really have such a personal and moral problem with abortion, then the real issue you would address is teaching people about things like safe sex and ultimately avoiding unwanted pregnancy's. If you feel any points I have made in this stage of the debate are unfair, or I haven't addressed issues you brought up let me know.",PRO,"If the parents genuinely feel that they can't look after a child because they aren't ready or they can't afford it, then I don't think that its ridiculous for them to want an abortion. ...

abortion,"I would like to thank pro for starting this debate so lets get right into it Definitions Abortion - the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus: as [1] Illegal - contrary to or forbidden by law, esp. criminal law. [1] So we are debating the act of abortion should be forbidden by law or not allowed. Premises [P1] Making abortion illegal would mean banning it in all circumstances [P2] If there is a time in which an abortion can be justified it should remain legal [P3] Therefore abortion should not be illegal Defense of Premise 1 This speaks for itself but basically per the resolution, we are debating about making abortion illegal across the board. It clearly states it should be illegal and should be banned by law. Defense of Premise 2 As I said my job in this is to show that there are some situations that can justify an abortion, but here are just a few. Fatal Pregnancies. Ecoptic pregnancies are rare pregnancies in where the egg implants itself somewhere outside the uterus. In addition to being outside of the uterus the mother generally can die. [2] Right to self defense According to US law this is essentially the right of another citizen to engage in violent behavior up and to ending another individuals life when the person in question is acting in sufficient self defense. [3] Justifiable Homicide Justifiable Homicide - killing without evil or criminal intent, for which there can be no blame, such as self-defense to protect oneself or to protect another, or the shooting by a law enforcement officer in fulfilling his/her duties. This is not to be confused with a crime of passion or claim of diminished capacity which refer to defenses aimed at reducing the penalty or degree of crime [4] Wrapping it up Essentially when a fetus is posing a life threatening condition to the mother it is her right to terminate the baby. She has every right to defend her body against the attack, in this case the fetus. Defense of Premise 3 This has already been essentially done above. Read defense of premise 2 for more details, but abortion should remain legal especially in cases where the mother could die. Conclusion The resolution is false.

abortion,"Same here, its my first debate on this site too. **I would just like to clarify that I am talking about first trimester abortion, as my views regarding post -fetal abortion are yet to be determined** Firstly, the fact that a placenta and the umbilical cord attach the fetus shows that the fetus cannot exist independent of the mother. We cannot consider the fetus as an individual entity because it cannot live outside the mother""s womb. Additionally, adoption is not an alternative to abortion, and if so, a rather poor one at that. Statistics show that less than three percent of all women who refuse abortion choose to give their child up for adoption. Even if I concede that adoption is an alternative, what kind of life is that for a child? Adoption generally comes with a negative connotation and with good reason. There is no guarantee that the child will have a family, and the child might get tied up in the foster system. Next, you mentioned the child (fetus""s) right to a choice and having a voice in what happens to them. By prohibiting and dismissing abortion you are in turn taking away the mothers choice and her civil right to control her own body. What is next? Forcing women to use contraceptives or undergo sterilization? Not to mention, in cases of teenage pregnancies, without the option of abortion you are taking away the young woman""s future. Furthermore, you say that being put up for adoption and bounced around the system is better than being dead, but the child was never alive to begin with. Statistics that were found on abortion.us show that pregnant women will resort to illegal and unsafe abortions if a legal option is not available. In many cases abortion is the best option, especially in cases of rape and incest where the child is unwanted and having the child can cause severe psychological problems for both the mother and the child. Children born as a result of incest are at risk of being deformed. We are talking about quality of life, and since a mother has the responsibility of bringing a life into the world, she should in turn have the right or option of an abortion. Finally, all women should have the right to choose to have an abortion, and the government or any religious authority should not limit them.",PRO,"**I would just like to clarify that I am talking about first trimester abortion, as my views regarding post -fetal abortion are yet to be determined** Firstly, the fact that a placenta and the umbilical cord attach the fetus",376
abortion,"I will be arguing that abortion should be illegal. I would like to point out 4 major points why abortion is not right. 1) IT IS ENDING A LIFE Some consider abortion to be murder since the being inside the mother is living. The definition of something living includes the ability to grow, which is exactly what is going on inside a woman who is pregnant. An abortion ceases the growing process, therefore ending the future life of a human being. This little being may not start off with a heartbeat or brain activity, but cells are still dividing and allowing it to grow... 2) ADOPTION IS ANOTHER OPTION Adoption is always brought up when people talk about aborting an unwanted child. The idea of aborting a child who would make a welcome addition to another family""s household is expressed by many pro-life individuals, including myself. There are tons of people who get rejected when they apply to adopt a child, which makes the idea of adoption seem far-fetched to these individuals. However, most people feel putting a child up for adoption is much better than going through an abortion. 3) DOCTORS ARE SUPPOSED TO SAVE LIVES The modern version of the Hippocratic Oath doctors take doesn""t specify that doctors are only to save people and make them better, but it is expected of them. The classic version of this oath actually has the phrase, """"I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy."" and the original Hippocratic Oath states, """"I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion."" Any mention of not performing an abortion has been taken out of the Hippocratic Oath, but not from the minds of people who expect doctors to save lives. 4) THERE WOULD BE LESS MENTAL ANGUISH CAUSED Women who go through an abortion have to forever carry that thought with them. They often wonder what their child would have looked like, acted like, and what type of person he/she would have been. No matter how strong a woman is, an abortion causes mental anguish that never truly goes away. At least with adoption a mother or father has the chance to see what their child has become.

abortion,"I thank my opponent for instigating this debate. ~Refutations~ ::Adoption:: In short my opponent's argument is that we should replace abortion with adoption. The link below shows a graph of children adopted or currently in care. http://www.acf.hhs.gov... There are many children put up for adoption, and adoption certainly is an alternative to abortion, but the number of adopted children are significantly less than those who are put up for adoption. What does this mean? Adoption is not an effective alternative to abortion. To make things more interesting, let's add on the number of fetuses aborted to the current number of children up for adoption. In 1996, there were 1.37 million abortions [1]. It exceeds the number of children that are already put up for adoption. Clearly, substituting abortion with adoption is ineffective. http://www.abortionno.org...

My arguments will be focused on why it should remain legal, as opposed to why it is ""wrong, sinful, or evil"" as that is subject to opinion. However, should my opponent choose to have a moral debate, I welcome the challenge. There was a period of time when abortion was illegal. ""The prohibition of legal abortion from the 1880s until 1973 came under the same anti-obscenity or Comstock laws that prohibited the dissemination of birth control information and services. Criminalization of abortion did not reduce the numbers of women who sought abortions. In the years before Roe v. Wade, the estimates of illegal abortions ranged as high as 1.2 million per year.1 Although accurate records could not be kept, it is known that between the 1880s and 1973, many thousands of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion. Many women died or suffered serious medical problems after attempting to self-induce their abortions or going to untrained practitioners who performed abortions with primitive methods or in unsanitary conditions. During this time, hospital emergency room staff treated thousands of women who either died or were suffering terrible effects of abortions provided without adequate skill and care."" http://www.prochoice.org...

abortion,"Thank you for accepting the debate. Essentially the only thing you have claimed that it is alright to kill people struggling based solely on financial reasons and on the mistakes of others. You have not yet attempted to refute wether the fetus is a human being or not, which is alright but makes my debate easier. 1. Should we kill those struggling with financial circumstances? In this case, we would be arguing that we would be willing the fetus out of mercy. However, how is killing an unborn human being showing any compassion? The truly merciful and compassionate reasoning leads us to protect the lives of those without a voice in all circumstances, whether that person may be the son of a billionaire or a poor man. We cannot determine the destiny and fate of anyone. Modern revelation of morality clearly shows that killing someone for how poor they might end up being is wrong. In this case as well, how are we to limit the time frame of the killing? With your reasoning, it would be just as merciful to kill a week old baby because they have been born into poverty merely based on the financial situation. Would you also be ok with this? Alveda King, the niece of MLK, a speaker on racial inequality and poverty, says this ""The abortion industry plants abortion clinics in minority neighborhoods and grey upon women who think they have no hope. The greatest irony of abortion is that abortion has done what the Klan (KKK) dreamed of."" 2. The actions of others do not grant the condemnation of another human being. We are all responsible for our actions, and guess what, if you get pregnant you cant run away from your problems no more than a gambler can run away from his debt. It may not feel good, but at that point, people understand the risks involved in sex and therefore, that person is now responsible for the child. However, as I personally know four adopted people very well, adoption is always an option. Wouldn't you say adoption is better than killing? 3.There is nothing immoral about suggesting when to have kids. However, we cannot legally force people to not have sex. That is when it crosses the legal border. And yes, every child should have the chance to live a healthy life, but you say being poor eliminates that chance which is why abortion is ok? That is a contradiction because abortion does the same thing. Abortion eliminates the chance that the child may live a healthy life. Abortion removes all chance of life itself, all the struggles, but all the opportunities as well. So abortion essentially denies all opportunity, more so than any level of poverty.",CON,"It may not feel good, but at that point, people understand the risks involved in sex and therefore, that person is now responsible for the child. ...

abortion,"""Two separate bodies because they have unique DNA."" When you need to remain attached to another body in order to grow so you can live, I don't consider that to be separate at all, even if they have unique DNA. ""If the child will cause her trauma, your argument can be used as an excuse to kill the child at one day old. You need to be more specific with that in regards to abortion itself."" My entire site has made it very clear in regards to abortion that the woman should be allowed to choose whether or not they should have an abortion WITHIN THE ALLOWED AMOUNT OF WEEKS. In many areas, legally that's twenty-four weeks but as I stated before most people get abortions within the first thirteen weeks. So no, my argument can't be used to defend killing a child after birth. My argument was always that women should be allowed to make the choice within the specified time period. ""Does finance determine whether someone should live?"" Well let's see, if I can't pay for my child to have a healthy birth, which greatly risks their chances of being born or being born healthy, then I'd say it's pretty important that I have the money to support a pregnancy. It's not just about what would happen to you financially if you keep it, it's about the financial issues involved with actually being pregnant. ""The law can be wrong."" So should we just ignore all laws because they could be wrong? Can I stop paying my taxes and argue that the law could be wrong and that it might be fixed in the future? No, I can't. ""I would argue that the law of double murder is the accurate law and the law of abortion is the incorrect law."" The law of abortion gives women the CHOICE to abort their child whereas the law of double murder does not give the victim a choice. Did she choose to get shot? Of course not. Did she consent to that form of abortion? Of course not. Can the women chose to have an abortion on her own? Yes, she can. So comparing the two laws is not the same. And the argument that the double murder law means abortion is also wrong does not hold because the law of abortion means that the mother has the LEGAL right of choice to decide whether or not to abort.

abortion,"Due to the substantial and unrecognized benefits of abortion, I urge a vote in affirmation. Contention One: A Fetus is Not a Human Being A fetus is not a human being. Abortion is terminating a pregnancy, not a baby. Person hood at conception is not a biological fact that has been proved. Person hood begins at birth. The reason society seems to believe that aborting a ""baby"" is to abort a human being but this belief is almost indefinitely nothing but a religious misconception. The anti-abortion position is usually a religious belief and threatens the vital separation of church and state. Religious ideology should not be a foundation for law in the United States. Those in which are non-religious don't see the vital importance of saving something that is not human in terms of abortion. Religion has even shaped society because the fight of abortion is almost indefinitely related to life or death. Contention Two: Misconceived Disadvantages Fetuses are incapable of feeling pain when an abortion is performed according to Stuart W. G. Derbyshire, PhD, Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham (England). ""Not only has the biological development not yet occurred to support pain experience, but the environment after birth, so necessary to the development of pain experience, is also yet to occur."" This shows that people are ignorant to the fact that a fetus doesn't truly know what is actually happening. Arguments of abortion should go deeper into the masses of different issues. Abortion does not hurt a fetus. Contention Three: The Impact of Illegal Abortions A) Access to legal, professionally-performed abortions reduces injury and death caused by unsafe illegal abortions. The World Health Organization estimated in 2006 that ""back-alley"" abortions cause 68,000 maternal deaths each year in countries where abortion is not legal. Just think of the consequences of unprofessionally having a baby aborted. Many women perform this action because they do not that motherhood should be a ""punishment"" for sexual intercourse, which leads to my next sub point; B) Motherhood must never be a punishment for having sexual intercourse. President Barack Obama said in a Mar. 29, 2008 campaign speech in Johnston, Pennsylvania, ""I have two daughters... I'm going to teach them first about values and morals, but if they make a mistake, I don't want them punished with a baby."" President Obama never made a collaborative decision to abort a child but he expresses a very good reason why such an action would be essential.

abortion,"In our country we should not be able to abort a child. Abortion is murdering and destroying a human life. This topic came up in the book Unwind by Neal Shusterman. In the book people are allowed to Unwind their child once they are 13 years old. Once a child is 19 they cannot be Unwind ed anymore. Unwinding is taking the vital organs about a young person and giving them to a donor. Technically the person who got Unwind ed is still ""alive"" they are just in another person. It is a very controversial topic that is expressed a lot in the book. The main characters Connor, Lev, and Risa all try not to get Unwound. Unwinding a child is equivalent to aborting a teen. Abortion is murder which is against what God said in one of the 10 commandments. Abortion can also give the mother who is aborting her child medical problems. A big medical issue that comes out of abortion is breast cancer. There are exceptions though, if a girl gets pregnant at 16 and is afraid to give birth she would probably abort the baby. Also, it is probably really embarrassing going to school with a baby in your belly. Everybody will question you and think differently of you.

For both medication and aspiration abortions, the exact costs depends on their location and their facility. ""Planned Parenthood estimates that in the United States a medication abortion costs between $300 to $800 and an aspiration abortion between $300""$950."" Also, many mothers have a difficult time talking about their experience with deciding whether to get an abortion or not to others because they are emotionally unstable about their experience. Also, each mother has many different beliefs, feelings, thoughts, values, and goals in life. They might feel anxiety and afraid of what everyone might think. Furthermore, there are risks for pregnant women who have had abortions in the past. Risks include vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy, preterm birth, low birth weight, and placenta problems. These problems and situations will make it difficult for women to have children. Also in 2014, most abortion patients had health insurance. About only thirty-five percent have Medicaid Coverage, while 31% had private insurances. However, insurance doesn't cover the abortion services, and even if it does, patients may not use their coverage for a variety of reasons.

I believe that abortion should be legal until this time is because the brain has not fully taken form yet and the fetus does not yet display complex behavior (R. Joseph).

But something goes wrong, and if she doesn't get the baby aborted, they will both die. In this case, abortion is the better option and even though it is killing the life of a soon-to-be baby, it is also saving the life of the mother. This has taken place multiple times, and without abortion, many more woman could die. Also, what if the sex wasn't their choice? What if a 13 year old girl who had already had her period got raped and got pregnant? Do you expect her to carry the child when she is not mentally ready to care for it, and even though it is possible for her to get pregnant, she isn't fully, physically ready to handle a child either? You could say she could have the baby and let her parents raise it, but a girl of young age giving birth to a child is very dangerous. It is always painful, but with a girl that young, there are more risks. So, I do agree with people using abortion as simple birth control is wrong, but abortion is not always wrong. People misuse it.

abortion,"I understand your argument; however, I simply cannot see how it applies to real world abortion discussions or compares in impact to the cost of an abortion. First off, any policy restricting abortion past 6-8 weeks would have the obvious exception clause for danger to a mothers life. This could be medically determined by any practicing doctor. Even countries with the strictest abortion laws, such as Poland or Ireland, have these exceptions. [1] Another factor to look at is the amount of women that die each year in childbirth. The accepted statistic is 17.8 in every 100,000. For sake of enhancing the opponents argument, lets round this to 20 in every 100,000. Since 4 million children are born a year [2], we can assume the number of women that die during childbirth is somewhere below 800 a year. Many of these deaths could be prevented with the abortion procedure exception, and the rest are true tragedies. However, roughly 1 million abortions occur a year [3], according to the most recent data, and at least ten or up to a hundred thousand of those deaths would be past the point where we determined a fetus becomes a human earlier in the round. A few hundred women simply cannot outweigh the tens of thousands of human babies that are killed each year. Therefore, the answer to maternal deaths simply cannot be legal and widespread abortion. Instead, better pre-natal and pregnancy treatment should be made available to pregnant women to prevent these deaths instead. Addressing your last line, the mere possibility of a women being killed by a fetus does not justify the act of abortion. Guaranteeing your own life by sacrificing another is not a choice that should be legal to make in society. P.S.

abortion,"Abortion is a perfectly moral action to partake in because of the following points. And yes, I would like to disagree with your statement that killing a human being is morally wrong, assuming you mean in all cases. 1. It should be up to the mother whether or not to have her own child. 2. Abortion of another woman's fetus will not affect you. 3. Population management. C. Therefore, abortion is moral. 1. When it comes down to it, it should be the mother's choice whether or not to have her own child. Who are you or me to tell her that she has to have a baby? Say a teenage girl gets pregnant because of a mistake she made. Should she be forced to have her child, possibly ruining her life? I say that the answer is no, it should be their choice whether or not to have their own child. 2. When a woman has an unplanned pregnancy, and chooses to abort, how does that choice impact you? Because I can tell you that it's going to impact the woman infinitely more if she is forced to have her child. A woman should not be forced to have a child by someone who will not be affected by this decision either way. It would be different if you were the woman's husband, and in this case a consensual decision would be best, but in the end, it should still be up to the one actually giving birth whether or not to abort the child. 3. If you do not agree with my previous points, then I will put one out based solely on the practicality of abortion. With the population rising exponentially, we'll eventually need to control the amount of children people have. Abortion is a practical method to limit population growth. This earth can't supply an unlimited number of people, and abortion is a practical way of ensuring against overpopulation. It may sound immoral to you, but it may be necessary in the future. C.

A human fetus is incapable of even experiencing the sensation of pain before 18 weeks [http://informahealthcare.com...]. As humans, we consider ourselves tertiary and 'intelligent' beings because of our ability to comprehend complex ideas. A fetus has no such capability and so should be considered a life form that is similar in social status, if not inferior, to other animals. The benefits of abortion to the mother Usually a mother has a rational reason for wanting to abort a child. Common reasons include financial incapabilities, social opposition, concern to physical health or just simply unwillingness. No one has the right to tell a mother, ""Your reason for wanting to abort is invalid."" Abortion is a choice to no one else but the mother. It is the mother that must go through the pain of labour to bear the child. It is the mother that must take on the responsibility to care for it. Abortion relieves the mother of this burden. Forcefully burdening the mother with a responsibility that she doesn't want or have the capability to fulfil is unethical and could be potentially harmful to many more people than simply the fetus - for example crushing a family's financial capabilities. I have presented my points, and shown that the benefits of abortion outweigh the detriments. I await my opponent's response.",PRO,"This is my first time participating in a debate, so please advise me on any proprieties I fail to adhere to. ...

It should be able to respond to environmental stimuli on demand (as opposed to adaptation, which occurs over time). It should be able to reproduce itself.

trump,"Firstly i want to thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate and wish them good luck. In my view Donald Trump would be an effective president for the USA. His generally hands off approach to world wide conflicts is in my view a positive thing. Yes he is negative about Russia, China and Iran but it is fair to say these three states do not currently have good relations with the USA anyway, so his policy towards them is no significant change to the previous administration. It is also fair to say these three countries have acted unethically in a variety of ways such as human rights abuses and acting with military aggression. It's fair to say they deserve some criticism. The border wall with Mexico is in my view a great idea. Illegal immigration is a key problem for the USA and if Mexico could be pursuaded to contribute towards the cost of its construction that would be an excellent economic and political result for the USA. What I think makes trump the strongest presidential candidate is the fact that he is not a career politician and has had an enormously succesful career in business. It is clear trump knows how to run a business and knows how a governments actions affect business first hand. Trump is one of the cleverist business brains in the US and surely tapping into that knowledge would be great for the USA. The fact the economy is in a perilous position with national debt and the national budget deficits at record high levels shows the current economic approach is not working. Trump will look at things from an economic point of view not a political point of view.

trump,"Before I jump in, I do not support Trump. I would like to sort of break this down. Yes, he has done several no good deeds, however, I believe the media amplifies his negatives, while shying away from the things he""s done well up to this point. First of all, jobs have been coming in at a continuing growing rate. He has already surpassed 1 million jobs created since early April (currently stands at 1.7 million). The employment rate continues to stay relatively low, at around 4.1%. There is a 62.7% labor participation rate, which is starting to make a comeback from the recession in 2008. There""s also been 159k manufacturing jobs created. Overall, jobs have been growing at a slow and steady rate. Also, the stock market has been doing very well under President Trump. Since Election Day of last year, the Stock Market has gained nearly 5 trillion dollars in monetary value. The main stock that went up exponentially was Dow Jones Industrial (DOW). Their company has surpassed 24k per stock, and will continue to rise, as it has been since the outcome of the 2008 recession. Of course, it""s not that much of an accomplishment, since it has been growing at a continuous rate, but the fact that it keeps climbing is always good. Overall, I believe Trumps cons outweigh his pros, but the government is still holding up, growing in fact. And trust me, there have been several presidents that were worse than Trump. There were several presidents who owned slaves, like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. There was Nixon who was part of the Watergate scandal, which eventually forced him to resign. Many more presidents doing way more bad things than Trump. Of course, Washington, Jefferson, even Nixon, didn""t do all that bad. No president can be terrible. Each and every US president has done bad things, yet they""ve also done good things as well.

They have terrorized them, hunted them down with dogs, and handed them over to the Border Patrol at gunpoint. (...) they have developed deep ties with powerful forces high in the government""and are operating in the era where any paranoid appeal for more security quickly gets official backing and a public hearing. (...) Mile by mile, walls and barbed wire have cut off Mexico from the United States, forcing more and more immigrants to cross over in the dangerous desolate stretches of border in Arizona. It has created an intense conflict zone, as desperate immigrant workers try to cross and survive, and an intensified government crackdown hunts them through the dry hills to trap them, capture them, (...) this reactionary Minuteman movement has emerged to demand even more extreme and violent actions against the immigrants. They have criticized the proposals made by President Bush and Mexico's President Vicente Fox to create a legal program for bringing Mexican immigrants into the U.S. So these Minutemen kill and hunt down not only illegal immigrants, but also innocent Americans.

trump,"I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. In early 2015, he brought up the idea that the government should start making deals with hospitals to help low income Americans. Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices. Today, his official healthcare plan affirms that he supports a 100% free market system, where insurance companies must compete nationwide - the exact opposite of universal healthcare. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible?

It may be that your initial definition was a bad one (or a too loosely defined one) but that’s irrelevant. You laid out a series of points that define fascist ideology. Trump fulfills or partially fulfills them all. Therefore Trump must be a fascist to a certain extent. One of the points themselves, Does not a fascist make. Not every nationalist is a fascist and almost everyone is a little nationalist. However when all of the points are true that does point to a certain ideology. It is true that all of these points apply to a lesser extent to almost every politician. That doesn't mean that every politician is a fascist (it might indicate that political power and fascism go hand in hand though). In normal vocabulary fascist is a relative describer. Hitler was a fascist only when contrasted to the west, In Germany many people considered him rational, Etc. . .

I will not argue either that Trump fulfills these ideologies completely or that they are the total of his policies. You can have fascist socialists (Nazis), Fascist Communists (Communists), And even fascist-like communal states (cults). Fascism is the name we give to a way of political thinking, Not an ideology in itself. So I move onto the 4 terms you specified: . . . That exalts nation and often race above the individual. . . This is probably the easiest to justify. MAGA is an issue of American pride, Exalting the nation above the individual.

Trump does not have absolute control of America (which would make him a complete dictator), But he is centralizing control of the National government and especcialy to his branch of government. A prime example is the issue of the wall. Where Trump, Unable to pass the plan through congress, Used a power of the executive branch (national emergency) to call for the wall anyway. This has been a consistent theme of his presidency. Him vs. Congress (which his party had control of anyway for the first two years) and him vs. The States (travel ban) . . . Severe economic and social regimentation. . . Again, Degrees. Trump has certainly leaned more towards economic regimentation (trade war with China, Criticism of NAFTA and free trade policies in general) and also social issues (Transgender ban, Appointing anti-pot Attorney General) . . . Forcible suppression of opposition. . . Trump has routinely called the media, His critics, And the actual oppositions the following: Fake news, Enemy of the people, phoney. The list of insults he has actually used is amazing. Although he has only used his power as president to forcibly suppress these voices vary rarely (banning CNN from whitehouse). The main force of trumps power is undoubtedly online and through a mob mentality of calling everything fake news. And even though this is not what we immediately think of as ""forcible"" is is still a type of force and so the statement is true to a certain degree.

trump,"The man leading the current race for the presidency is who? None other than Donald J. Trump. Why is this? Why are people voting for him? I'm both curious and scared. To start this debate, I'll use one of the most obvious points as to why people should not be voting for this man. Racism. In a world that is constantly moving forward, away from a time of racism and prejudice, why is it that there are so many people voting for a man who wishes to bring an end to equality for coloured people? This world is always changing, always evolving, and I had thought that humans, as a species, had moved on from blanket racism. Apparently not, if the majority of Americans are voting for a man who has openly endorsed racist violence. This brings me to another issue on equality. Donald Trump has expressed interest in rescinding marriage equality rights for members of the LGBTQ+ community. He says he is for 'natural marriage'. As I have already said, this world is forever moving onwards. Why take away the rights of a person simply because of their sexual orientation? Why vote for the person that wants to? Trump has also said that he has a big issue with Muslims. This is another example of blanket racism from the man himself. If a minority of Muslims are part of fundamentalist and extremist groups, does that really mean that you should tame away the right to worship from the majority? What Donald Trump, and indeed the people who vote for him for this reason, have failed to realise is that the majority of Muslims are not a part of these groups. He has expressed wishes to close the mosques, but for what reason? Does he really think that will solve his 'problem'? Do you?

Donald Trump covers himself by saying that he was a businessman and as such, he gave money to a lot of different causes and people, that was the way business was done. Isn't the reason that Donald Trump is gaining so much support is because the conservatives and republicans in general are becoming fed up with the way the ""Good old boys, ""/ Establishment republicans, and establishment democrats, have been doing business as usual in Washington. Maybe though the Conservative republicans think that those who have been elected to office weren't listening to conservatives and independents and haven't been for a long time and are now willing to take a chance that Donald Trump will listen to them and will promote the things that conservatives believed in. Betting on Donald Trump to be the conservatives and independents friend is a gamble, only time will tell whether the gamble paided off,if Donald trump actually believed in what he said that he believed in.

Economy Donald Trump is going to make America poor again. A group of expert economists did a study on Trump's purposed 35% tarrif on Mexico and 45 tarrifs on China and the results are disasterous. It will cost the Average American $11,500 in increased prices over the next 5 years, and these numbers are expected to continue to climb [1]. It will cost poor Americans 53% of their income and prices will rise 30%. US exports to these nations will decline by 78%! If you want to make America great again, then Trump is not the right answer. Sure Trump may oppose the TPP, but so does Hilary [2]. Trump is simply in love with Hillary and the Democrats, ""I've been around a long time. And it just seems the economy does better under the Democrats than under Republicans. [3]"" Foreign Policy I have previously brought up Hilary's peace deal with Israel and Hamas stoping a war. What has Trump done to even come close to this? Trump actually supported the Iraq War, Trump had stated on the Howard Stern show that he supported the Iraq war when asked. In a seperate interview, he said he'd supported it since the markets would skyrocket [4]. Sounds like strong support to me. As much as Trump likes to bash the Iran deal, we can call this a huge success for Hilary, she created the sanction that finally brougth Iran to it's knees while all the other sanctions just encouraged Iran to continue nuclear developement [5]. Trump stated that he would hammar them with sanctions, but if that was true, Iran would have a nuke under Trump. Speaking of the Iran deal, Trump had originally supported the deal [6]. This is just another foreign policy flip flop by Trump. Bengahzi is a dead issue, Hillary Clinton was interviewed by the Bengahzi investigation pannel headed by Trey Goudy and easily won out.

I would take Trump, a man who has experienced bankruptcy over Obama, the ""constitutional law professor"" who could not be more hypocritical and has never experienced work in the market before.

He filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, making it the first club in Palm Beach to accept black and Jewish people.

First off Hillary has done so many things evil in her life that she cannot and, in fact, shouldn't even be allowed to be president. Hillary is worse than Trump for the following reasons: Hillary supports the killing of babies, even after the nine week mark, as well as after birth. She says that babies aren't babies until they leave the hospital. This is outrageous and wrong, and she knows it. She is pro-choice, which is pro-death. Hillary sent private and confidential information by email, and when it was discovered, deleted about 30,000 emails, and lied saying that they were about a yoga program and her daughter's wedding. Really? Like Trump said, that must have been a big wedding. According to nytimes.com (http://www.nytimes.com...) 8 of the emails that were released contained top secret information, 36 contained secret information, 8 contained confidential information, and 2,000 were classified as confidential. These emails show that she can jeopardize America by giving secret information to the wrong people. Hillary should be in jail. In newly leaked videos, the Democratic party were hiring people to incite violence at Trump's rallies, and they were also trying to figure out how to accomplish voting fraud for Hillary. Hillary left a couple people to die. She was heartless. Hillary has done terrible things that people, who have only done one fifth of what she did, have been put in jail for. Hillary is evil, and will ruin America, and she has so many other faults and failures. Trump will set a new stage. Hillary will only continue what Obama has done and worse, and nothing will change dramatically. Trump on the other hand, who is not a politician and doesn't use the tactic ""lie about everything if it makes you look good just to gain the people's vote,"" which is what Hillary does, will make a change. Trump is a business man and he knows how to make good deals with our allies. Trump will whipe the slate clean and we can start fresh. Trump is better than Hillary because Trump has never given anyone confidential information, and he will stick to what he has said he will do. Trump is for the American people, Hillary is for herself.

Trump tried to sue the department for 10 million, claiming defamation of character. The company settled out of court, and agreed to give A vacancy list to a certain number of black applicants. However, 3 years later, his organization was sued yet again, for lying to blacks and Puerto Ricans, about the availability of apartments. I believe this fits in with your second definition of racism: A policy, system of government, etc., based upon or fostering the doctrine that one race is superior, and has the right to dominate others; discrimination. Trump also stated that a judge named Gonzalo Curiel, who was presiding over a case against Trumps own university, could not be impartial because he is Mexican.

trump,"Donald Trump is far from perfect. He is far from it, Not only failing at several things as president but also as a businessman. As president, Trump's biggest failure is the coronavirus and the slow reaction of his White House. Despite being warned several times, President Trump refused to accept the reality of the coronavirus, Assuring the country that it was ""under control"". However, It became very obvious that the country was not safe, And by the time Trump finally took proper action, The US was the new hotspot of the virus. Even now, As we accept our new reality, Trump ignores the virus, Pushing for reopening with disregard to coronavirus guidelines and the safety of our citizens. As a businessman, Trump has also had his failures. One of his many failures is his involvement in casinos. Trump's Taj Mahal was the most expensive project he had ever participated in when it first opened, Costing a whopping $1 billion dollars to build. It was located in Atlantic City, And attracted thousands of visitors each day it was open. However, A year later, The casino had failed to make enough profit to cover its cost, Going into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Trump, Who could not afford to pay $1 billion dollars back to the banks that he had lended from, Was forced to sell his yacht and airline, Both a huge part of his figure and pride back then. As you can tell, Trump is far from perfect. He has made many mistakes in his life and will most likely continue to do so up until his death. These two major failures are just a sample of his failures, And it would be absurd to call Trump perfect.",CON,"However, It became very obvious that the country was not safe, And by the time Trump finally took proper action, The US was the new hotspot of the virus. ...

trump,"It is without question that this Presidential election is by no means another election. This election is different because we are faced with an outsider as the Republican candidate on the ticket this year. That""s without getting into an argument about the Democratic selection, but it must be mentioned because she adds to the interest in this case. However, Donald Trump being an outsider is a good thing. His ideas are not radical; they just go against the way things have been done. Its time to take a turn off the same road we""ve been driving on for years and see where that takes us. Donald Trump owes no one for the position he is in. Meaning no political favors, positions, or influence. Trumps comments in the media have drawn a lot of attention. People saying he is a loose canon, and that he has no filter between his brain and his mouth. Which in turn means transparency. A man who isn""t afraid of his own ideas, a man who says what he thinks. Not a man who has filtered his ideas through rooms full of people who have polled every sentence that will be said to know how it will play on the American people. Donald Trump has ideas as I will continue to explain. He wants to bring jobs back to the American worker. He wants to stop outsourcing jobs to China and other places where the work can be done cheaper. With souring unemployment, why wouldn""t we want this. Unemployment effects everyone in almost every aspect of their life. Taxes go up, crime rates go up, and the list goes on. Bringing Jobs back to America is a great thing. Now down to the nitty gritty of things. His proposed policies. This is why I support Donald Trump for the Republican nomination for President of the United States. One of the areas that seems to get hit hardest is his immigration policy. Building of the wall. Mexico who had a problem with immigration and drug trade from their southern border did the same thing. They built a wall. Why shouldn""t we. It is not racist, hurtful, or hateful. I am expected to obey the laws of the land, so should every person in this country. Coming to this country illegally, well is illegal. There is nothing wrong with building a wall to slow immigration, and ask people to legally immigrate into the United States.

trump,"Rebuttal: Donald Trump is without a doubt a successful businessman, and is very knowledgeable about the economy. However, Donald Trump is not a politician. He may have what it takes to employ the people of his businesses, but that does not mean he will be able to find a way to employ the millions of Americans without a job(from a political standpoint). Trump has been proved to fail in many business situations as well; he is not all just success. Take a look at the scandal involving Trump University. At the start, Trump University violated the law of operating without proper license, according to the NYSED license code of conduct.[1] Given the fact that Trump had violated laws in order to make money suggests how Trump may not even be that great of a businessman in the end, considering that he has to break laws in order to make his fortune. (Not to mention, the numerous lawsuits upon Trump following the scandal). Due to these reasons, the argument that Trump would make a good president because of the fact that according to Pro, he is a ""good businessman"" is faulty. (Not to mention the fact that your contention is extremely superficial) Contention 2: Trump would not make a good president because he does not practice as he preaches. Trump says that as president, he will look to employ American workers, and find Americans specifically, jobs. This is a faulty Trump statement as he has even openly admitted that in his companies, he does not employ as many American workers as he should. Trump turned down 94 percent of job applicants from American workers.[1] Trump promises to get more Americans employed, but is that what truly wants? If that were truly what Trump wanted, he would not have declined 94 percent of American applicants for his companies. Trump would make a poor president because he does not practice what he says his ideology is. Thanks for the great debate! You had strong arguments!

trump,"Donald Trump is has a great spasm of intelligence. Much beyond the average small brain capacities of the American people. It's been said over and over again that Trump has played us this entire election race since the beginning. The amount of viewers who don't pickup on the cues of his cunningness surprised me. The whole point into his rants and controversy has made him receive hate, but has also made him win the primary election. Trump has saved billions of dollars in advertising for his campaign by using News outlet and channels to promote his agenda. That alone, is smart, and money productive. TO anyone that hates trump because of his personality, you're just playing yourself. As to his government policies, he is an awesome president in protecting our country and bringing back jobs. Trump has built a wall for a reason, and it's because scummy Mexicans cannot afford to buy plane tickets and stay overnight through Visa's so the next best thing is jumping over the borders. And jumping over the border IS, truly, the best way to remain anonymous from government tracking and becoming advocating crime or transporting drugs into our country without anyone ever knowing your identity. Jobs have also slowly coming back. Trump has signed Wisconsin to act on one of the central tenets of his administration so far -- keeping jobs inside the United States -- by signing a new executive order aimed at guarding domestic labor. Trump's plan to focus on traditional and physical labor side of things is a smart idea, as nearly 45% of all Americans do not own a laptop! Laptops are the holy principle to UNDERSTANDING and knowing HOW TO USE technology, creating programs, code and technology itself. Based of this alone I think Trump needs to stay focused on improving our agricultural and physical labor economies in these next couple years.

trump,"My stance is simply this: A prediction that Trump will not be convicted in the Senate during the upcoming impeachment trial.

Although it is not literally impossible for Trump to be convicted, I do not think he will be. The reason for this is simple: Enough Republicans will not do so.

The Democrats can put on any amount of iron-clad evidence. Trump could testify on his own behalf and flat-out admit that ""I staged a coup and really intended that the good patriots kill Mike Pence and all the Democrats so I could remain in power as a dictator."" It doesn't matter. The Republicans will not vote to convict in the numbers necessary.

My evidence supporting this position is:

* The Senate vote on whether to proceed, 55-45, on the basis of Constitutionality

Regardless of whether you believe the proceedings are constitutional, this is the easy-out vote for the R's. ""I would convict BUT I just don't feel it's constitutional."" Mitch McConnel's vote in this way is, to me, immensely telling of the way this will go.

* Republican support of Trump remains high

The first reason Trump would make a good president is the fact that he will be more strict on immigrants. Building a wall is a smart idea because even though people cross over our borders illegally, we still allow some of them to reside here. This is wrong because the U.S. government is rewarding them for breaking laws. When Trump builds a border fence, this will stop because the immigrants will have to cross over legally and the bad ones will be filtered out easily. The second reason Donald Trump would make a good president is his stance on terrorism. ISIS does horrible things and they must be stopped. A temporary restriction on Muslims entering the country is a good idea because, lets face facts, most terrorists are Muslims. If we put a restriction on Muslim's entering the country, it will be much easier to fight against ISIS without having terrorists in our country.

I can't really know what you are thinking so I will now compare Trump to Obama because of your failure to state your side sufficiently. I will argue for why Obama is better than Trump. Employment rate Obama started his presidency in January 20 2009 and left office in January 2017. Looking at the first source I have provided Obama when took office was the one who started the downwards trend of unemployment. If Trump had some significant impact of reducing unemployment then Con will be able to point to a law and the time frame when this law took place. Obama started off at a 10% unemployment rate which he reduced it by 2% when he was first elected. When he was elected again Obama was able to reduce the unemployment from 8% to around about 5%. These numbers are more impressive than Trump even. Currently Trump has reduced the unemployment rate by 1% which does not look like to be reduced by 2 which means Trump if I am correct would not have done better than Obama's first election cycle in office. Honesty Going by the third and fourth sources Trump has stated more mostly false, False and pants on fire statements compared to Obama. Even though Politifact was keeping data on Obama even before he was elected in 2009 somehow Trump manages to mislead the public more than Obama. This shows Trump is not capable of verifying what he is saying instead does not think before he says something. 24% of Obama's statements were mostly false, False or pants on fire whereas 69% of Trump's statements were mostly false, False or pants on fire and it is not even the end of his presidency while also taking into account Obama has been tracked by politifact for a much longer period. I will leave it at that. I don't think I can be blamed with the approach I have taken in this debate because Con did not clearly state what he wanted.

trump,"Actually, I never said that I agree that there was racial bias in the company. I only said that any racial bias (which doesn't confirm there was racial bias, it's just a hypothetical statement) would be attributed to Fred Trump considering Donald Trump was only an apprentice in 1973. That being said, it would seem that Trump won the lawsuits. All Trump has to do was read the Fair Housing Act and advertise to minorities. 2. Yes, I agree that his role in the birther movement was inspired by Obama's ties to foreign countries. The birther movement revolves around the idea that Barack Obama was not born directly in America. Barack Obama was allegedly (not proven) born in Kenya because his mother was not allowed to travel by plane. His mother than took him back to Hawaii to register his birth. That's the story that spawned the birther movement. The real, original birther movement had little to nothing to do with his relationship to Muslims. Although I think the birther movement is absurd, considering Obama would still be a citizen of the United States, it's very misleading, meaning that one can easily fall for it. 3. By your logic, Trump wouldn't want immigrants (legal or otherwise) period. You said he would ease up on migration restrictions and paperwork if he were really pro-immigration. The thing is though, the restrictions and paperwork apply to immigrants from all over - meaning that racism is not involved. Furthermore, 'Mexican' is a nationality, and 'illegal immigrant' is a status, neither of which are races. That being said, you did not refute my argument that there have been 3 million arrests attributed to a population of only 11 million other than calling it 'disputable'. 4. Actually, I was referring to Gonzalo Curiel's society called La Raza Lawyers. I was not referring to Hispanics. Trump also clarified that he was talking about the society on the full interview featured on your source. 5. He's only banning those from countries with heavy influence of terrorism. What if terrorists infiltrated the United States as refugees as they did in Europe? I don't think a Muslim ban from countries with high terrorist influence is racist, I think it is common-sense. The Holocaust is completely different from the Muslim ban. The Holocaust consisted of the killing of Jews, where most of them were innocent people. The Muslim ban is a temporary way to prevent terrorists from getting into our country. 6. Just because racists like him, doesn't make him racist.

trump,"My opponent has stated economic examples of President Trump's influence on the United States. While I will address the flaws in Pro's argument on the economic influence later in this argument, I will first point out that economic prosperity of a country is not the sole factor of quality. Another factor is foreign affairs, in which America has taken a decline in through several administrations. Under President Trump, however, the United State's foreign policy has made its way closer and closer to violent instigation. Even before the presidency, during his campaign, President Trump angered other world leaders with his rhetoric. Mexican President Enrique Pe""a Nieto showed dissent over President Trump's statement on Mexico paying for the proposed border wall (1). This is just one example, others being the reaction of foreign powers to the tariffs placed by President Trump. Secondly, President Trump has repealed certain Obama-era policies that were very beneficial to the United State's well-being. Things such as clean energy policies are on this list. Clean energy policies help to further the longevity of American infrastructure through allowing our power grid to be sustainable for much longer than on coal power. Trump has also forbidden transgender citizens from serving in the United States military. This was defended by attempting to lower military spending, however, a study found the closest to a flat-rate number, which is difficult due to differences in transition procedures, to be $8.4 million. This may seem like a large number, but after you do the math with the $50 billion budget the Department of Defense has, you find that the ban only saves the military 0.017% (2). President Trump has forbidden an estimated 1,320 to 6,630 trans citizens in the active component. Finally, we get to the economic prosperity. The 3% number was released prematurely. In fact, the actual number of 2.3% economic growth for 2017 is only a bit more than Obama's last term of 1.5% (3). However, the American economy has been on an increasing rate of growth since the Recession. It's hardly a valid point to say the .8% increase can be accredited to President Trump.

This I can agree to but when it comes to how the budget problem is solved there is no right way and stating that Trump's reduction of taxes is going to make it worse has no validity, except your perception of it simply being common sense. To me, common sense, means reducing tax and cutting unnecessary social programs that our government pours millions into everywhere. With that perspective, what makes your common sense more valid and true than mine? If you had provided sound and solid evidence with credible sources, I would have been able to reevaluate my stance. However, with out the evidence, to me it is just an opinion. The same goes for the rest of your examples you provided no substantial evidence to base your opinions on. It is also important to recognize that you state how Obamacare is benefits the citizens as if its the only correct way to provide health care. How can we know that Trump doesn't have a plan that can work equally as well? Finally, asking me if I ""care about the poor and disabled people"" is irrelevant to the argument. We are arguing whether Trump supporters are irresponsible, not my stance on social issues. In conclusion, I believe that those who vote for Trump are not irresponsible. Those who vote for him simply believe that he would be the best fit in office. For those who do agree with his political stance, have different opinions than those who oppose him and his views. Those opinions in no way reflect their character. I believe that it would be better to state: "" I don't agree with those supporting Trump for reasons A, B and C. Here is the evidence supporting my claim that these reasons may have negative effects on the United States in the following year.""

trump,"As 2020 draws near, there seems to be the idea that Trump is going to lose the election in 2020 because he is deemed unpopular with the electorate, doesn't accomplish anything, and is mentally incompetent to run a country. Also, his scandals. I would like to say that he would lose against the next opponent in 2020. However, if you followed the election even a little bit, you would remember that he was destined to lose by the media for being unfit, offensive, not having ideas, etc. He was seen losing the election by 3, 5 and even 10 points. Clinton was going to win in a landslide. Well, we all know what happened. We all know she won the popular vote and should've won.

trump,"I would like to bring attention to some factors that I believe were important in Donald Trump's victory, that will likely not be present in the 2020 elections. First, Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, was also very unpopular. For most of the campaign she too was below 50% popularity. This shows in some of the closest states in the 2016 election: Michigan--0.3%, New Hampshire--0.4%, Wisconsin--1%, Pennsylvania--1.2%, and so on. Two unpopular candidates led to very close margins. However, when we look at Trump’s approval rating, for the most part he has gotten less and less popular since winning the Presidency. There’s been a minor uptick in popularity, but he’s had similar short term fluctuations previously. Meanwhile it cannot be assumed that the Democratic challenger will be as unpopular as Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. So what we are likely to see is that while Donald Trump enters the 2020 election with even lower popularity than in 2016, his opponent will likely enter with higher popularity than Hillary Clinton. With the razor thin margins Trump won by in several states, such a shift could easily give the state to the Democrats. Related is that Hillary Clinton was under a very public investigation throughout the election. That, along with the last minute revelation of the investigation restarting also hurt her chances in the general election. In effect in the 2016 election, Donald Trump was running on easy mode against a candidate that even a majority her own party didn’t like or trust, yet still just barely beat out his opponent in multiple states. Against a more popular and trusted candidate, Donald Trump is highly unlikely to win in 2020. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com... http://abcnews.go.com... http://abcnews.go.com...",PRO,"I would like to bring attention to some factors that I believe were important in Donald Trump's victory, that will likely not be present in the 2020 elections.  ...

trump,"First I would like to point out that, as of now, it is impossible for people who oppose Trump to deny him the nomination. The RNC rules committee failed to get the amendment passed that would unbind the delegates which would potentially cause them to vote for another candidate instead of Trump. (1) Second, if the Republicans tried to stop Trump, it would guarantee a heavy loss in the November election. Donald Trump had received a total of 14 million votes during the primary, almost 50% more than Mitt Romney had received in the 2012 primary (10 million)(2), and about 60% more than John McCain had received in the 2008 primary (9.9 million)(3). There is no argument about it. Trump is more popular than the last two Republican candidates. The people of the GOP had made a democratic decision to vote Trump into the nomination. Turning against that would go against the will of the people, and upset millions of potential/registered voters. Ditching Trump would cause these angry people to either stay home (similar to 2012) or vote for another party out of spite. This would likely lead to a handy Clinton victory and a loss of both House and Senate control. If Clinton became president, she would have the opportunity to appoint up to three new Supreme Court justices over her terms. Being a liberal, she would choose judges who would adhere to her views. With Democratic control of Congress, she could easily get any number of bills passed that would likely upset the GOP and its constituents. There is the potential for a long-lasting negative effect for Republicans if Trump would be denied the nomination, especially at this point with the convention coming next week and the general election underway.

I intend to do this using simple language and I will not, like many others on this site, over complicate my argument with unnecessary adjectives and adverbs. That is not directed at my opponent today, it is simply a passing point. Firstly, my opponent believes Trump is the only presidential candidate to give a robust policy for security measures, I disagree. Not a single presidential candidate has assumed that security threats are not an issue, and instead of proposing a policy in which an entire ethnic and religious group is banned, republican candidates have offered simple solutions. The debate between Ted Cruz and increased surveillance demonstrates an individual who recognises the balance between State power and individual liberties. Trump's policies return the U.S. to a state of constant fear and turmoil due to the scaremongering of his policies. He has continued to seek out minorities and foreigners as targets for his claim that the U.S. is returning to a ethnically mixed melting pot of religious belief and cultural diversity. A principle the U.S. is founded on, yet Trump is re-writing history to slot in his narrowed ideology of 'us vs. them'. It also must be asked how can Trump be 'an amazing president' when he violates the First Amendment of his constitution? For Liberals, Trump encapsulates their cynical idea of a Republican. Loud, obnoxious and consistently bigoted and narrowed minded. For Republicans though, Trump is offering policies that as Pro said would 'ensure our safety', meaning secure our liberties and freedom with the knowledge of our safety. Yet, to ensure our safety, Trump has decided to undermine the basic liberties of the country he so loves. The First Amendment forbids any law that qualifies a person's rights through religious tests. Trump's ban on Muslims is completely unconstitutional and decries the Tyranny of the majorities that the Founding Fathers sought to remedy. I simply must ask, to whom is Trump an amazing president? He is going against the Republican values of limited government and upholding the constitution and for Democrats he is is blunt and anti-thesis to social democratic and progressive movements. I also fail to see how Trump, who has, throughout his campaign, denounced China and criticized its growth will be to the betterment of our economy'. He has burned bridges with British parliament, Chinese government, Mexican workers, Muslim workers and so on. The climate of a pseudo-isolationist policy is present in Trump's economic policy. A policy roundly slammed on both sides when it was proposed by Ron Paul in the previous presidential elections.

brexit,"Hello! I have a number of arguments that will be elaborated upon in further posts. For now, here they are: 1. Global Economic Impact As we have already seen, the Brexit has already led to severe economic implications in markets worldwide. Over $2 trillion have already been lost just in one day (June 24).This has resulted in worldwide stock markets plunging in value. Spain's IBEX 35 fell 12.5%, NASDAQ fell 3.6%, Europe's Euro Stoxx 50 tumbled 9.1%, and Japan's NIKKEI 225 fell 7.9%. The British pound has plummeted to its lowest level in thirty years in just one day! British trade will be hindered by not being able to easily trade with the continent. This will inevitably result in further economic trouble in Britain even after this initial damage outlined above. As for Europe: the EU just lost its biggest economy. This will mean that the whole of Europe just got a whole lot poorer, because Britain no longer has easy access to trade. What will this mean for countries like Greece? What will happen to the European continent if there's an economic downturn? The financial security of Europe and all of its trading partners will be made much weaker because of Brexit. 2. Impact on Britain As we both know, there was a referendum in Scotland in September of 2014 to secede from the UK. It failed and the UK is still whole. In the Brexit vote, Scotland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. Already there is talk in Scotland of seceding and rejoining the European Union. There is also a movement starting for the reunification of Ireland (meaning the UK would also lose Northern Ireland). If these happen and the UK is split into three pieces, the consequences will be both profound and irreparable. The UK is our strongest ally overseas. If it splits, NATO, the UK, and the US will be much less powerful, both militarily and economically. Brexit has already set this in motion. Would you (or anybody) knowingly and willingly support the weakening of our country? 3. Peace in Europe The organizations that led to the EU were founded in 1945, just after World War II. The idea was to create a union of countries that would be so closely intertwined that war between them would be unthinkable. After Brexit, other countries are already clamoring to leave the EU as well. This Brexit has started a long domino chain that will eventually result in the collapse of the EU. At some point, there will be war in Europe because of this collapse.

brexit,"Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to work the dirty jobs such as farming so migrants need to do it for them. [1] Let's Look at the facts. Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 Billion pounds or 0.3% of britains GDP. So for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%.

brexit,"While there may be a few advantages to the Brexit, I find it very unnecessary. From now on, It could only go wrong and Theresa May has brought the UK to its now inevitable so-called ""economic disaster"". For example, The Panasonic Corp is to move its European headquarters from London to Amsterdam in October to avoid potential tax issues linked to the Brexit. This is a loss of hundreds of jobs, Which is definitely detrimental to the UK population. Even though the flow of immigrants are stemmed, This could be highly detrimental to the availability of jobs in the UK, Especially London where the headquarters are located. It's not a surprise that other companies move their headquarters to other countries of the EU as well, Which results in more job loss. In my opinion, The Brexit is definitely one of the biggest downfalls the UK has experienced and it's a shame that the population of the UK even voted that it would be a good idea.

Foreign investors like investing in the UK because it gives them easy access to the EU's single market (which means less borders in moving goods, less tarriffs, and more profit). Brexit makes it harder for UK to trade with EU. Deals can be made but will probably not be as good as it was before Brexit. Thus, investors look elsewhere than UK. UK loses a varied amount of FDI. Graph: http://tinyurl.com... Any deals made, is likely to be complicated. The leaders of the EU have already said that in order for UK to access the single market, it must allow free movement of EU workers (for them to easily immigrate to the UK). [2] Brexit means EU workers may not meet requirements for working in the UK, especially filling out the infamous UK visa test for non-EU citizens. About 3/4 of EU workers would fail this test, those in the primary and secondary sector (farming, hotel staff etc.). [3] It's not just a problem of foreign workers.

The migrant crisis is reaching epic proportions all the way to France because the borders were open and the migrants came cross all borders unobstructed. From Italy and Turkey through the rest of open Europe through the poorer nations all heading for England the most prosperous country in the EU. A border crossing with northern and southern Ireland is also critical in keeping the IRA at bay and controlling movement of people. Open borders are a disaster for security reasons.

The Gypsies can roam all around Europe without obstruction. And finally the migrants from the middle east including ISIS can freely cross from Turkey to anywhere in Europe.

Let me assure him that I have quite a good idea of what opportunity cost means. He then brings in some technical terms with the hopes of confusing us to believe in him. Basically, he brushes off my argument which is the net high costs of remaining in the EU by accusing my data as biased and claiming that the opportunity of free trade justifies the cash. We have to remember that the costs of remaining in the EU have been rising STEADILY these past few years. If it has just been rising the last couple of years, yes, we might still be optimistic. But the truth is we are starting to question how much of a benefit this supposed free trade is when the figures have continuously been rising. When you consider that these costs are almost at par with medical costs in Britain, how long can we trick ourselves into thinking that ""you know, this is all for free trade. All this cost is justified."" And that is why I brought up the countries Norway and Switzerland. These countries are proof that you can stay out of the EU without having to succumb to membership fees. I was not at all implying that Britain should adopt a Nordic model. Of course, as a country with values of its own, they should negotiate a different treaty and a different model that suits them. Finally, I agree that America has no rights to comment on the Brexit. I was in no way implying that we should 'make Britain great again' as per Trump's model. And I never said that we should disallow refugees/migrants.

brexit,"Ok, let's agree with the opposition. Let's say that the costs incurred when Britain has to trade with each country separately is higher than the membership fee of being in EU. First of all, economic experts themselves cannot agree whether which scenario is going to incur more cost, especially when you consider that even if Britain does leave the EU it is going to take at least 2 years to gradually leave the EU and to finalise new laws and trade agreements.

My opponent then argues terrorist ideas are home grown, not brought in and therefore an emphasis should be on the education system. I simply cannot agree with this. The fact that most terrorists have radical Islamic views are because they are from Islamic descent. To mitigate this problem, you can't bring in more people from Islamic countries (assuming this is Syria, Iraq etc) and expect that you know, nothing is going to happen and we're all going to live happy in a multicultural society. Which is exactly why, at this period in history with influx of migrants from Muslim countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel, we need to have more control over our borders. It is our concern that Brussels will force us to terms that will impact our community, particularly with regards to the public's sensitivity about muslims and terrorism. The fact that member states can share info to me is not at all a good reason to remain in the EU. The war on terrorism is a war fought collectively by all countries whether or not we remain in EU. America, Canada, Australia all non-EU countries contribute to our info on potential terrorist threats. And when we still cannot prevent incidents like that in Sydney and Paris, we should not pretend that just by sharing info we can solve terrorism altogether. Notice that I am not at all saying that all Muslims are terrorists. I am saying that we have to take the necessary precautionary steps with the knowledge that most terrorists are muslims.

brexit,"Thank you good proposition. The issue I will adress now is the fact that there is strength in number. Firstly, when we talk about trade, supposedly right, that there are 'too much' costs that are incurred when Britain remains in the EU. Also, when the proposition is trying to talk about the economic benefits or costs, he/she should have basic understanding of economics itself, in line with political situations. Suppose that Britain leaves the EU, the cost they will incur to facilitate trade with respective countries that they trade with will be far more than the alleged value thay Britain is paying for its 'membership'. Also, when we talk about secuirty, Britain is actually much safer when they remain in the EU. Yes, the proposition might argue that by being in the EU, with its Schengen area, Britain cannot control its borders from the the threat of 'terrorists', but studies have shown, that these terroriet attacks, such as the Paris bombing, is homegrown. Yes, these 'terrorists' might be foreign in descent, but we cannot blame the immigration system for this. It is the issue of the educational system. How is Britain more secure by being in the EU? In terms of immigration itself, be it refugees or economic migrants, member states can share information and costs, and through distribution of costs, respective countries can achieve economies of scale through agglomeration. But this still does not answer how secure Britain can be. The Office for Budget Responsibility reports that much of public services are financed by taxes by immigrant workers. Also there's a high correlation economic growth with the level of immigration. This provide a security net for Britain in terms of its financial security. Talking about finances, leads to my next point, on the issue of services provided by Britian for the rest of EU, especially when we consider the fact that Britian is a service-based economy. The financial services centre in Britain employ around 2.1 million people, and this bulwark of the industry is stable mainly because of the EU internal market legislation.

The justice system is not perfect and many innocent people have been convicted by it, The problem with the death penalty is that there is no way to go back on sentences and fix mistakes when new information about a case is found. There have been a number of people in the US who have been sentenced to death who later have been found out to be innocent. If these people were just sent to prison these mistakes could have been reversed and fixed. Secondly I find the argument that the death penalty will deter crime to be a bad one. I feel that this is very logical. If someone is that messed up in the head to even consider killing someone or doing something equally as bad and inhumane, Do you really think that the prospect of death is going to deter them from doing it? Also, One thing that I've noticed many people who are in favour of the death penalty don't realise is that the death penalty is in fact very expensive. According to the Death Penalty Information Centre, In the US the average costs for a non-death penalty murder case is $1. 1 million ($870, 000 in imprisonment, $250, 000 in trial), While the average costs for a death penalty case are $3 million ($1. 3 million in imprisonment, $1. 7 million in trial). For these reasons and more I strongly believe that the death penalty is a bad thing and should absolutely be repealed in countries that it is implemented in such as the US. https://deathpenaltyinfo.

death penalty,"Though there are people who say that the death penalty is cruel and unusual, there are the facts that the possibility of the death penalty actually does cross most criminals minds before committing a murder. In an article by Michael Kronenwetter, the facts are clear about the death penalty, ""In the early 1970s, the Los Angeles Police Department conducted interviews with 99 criminals who had not carried lethal weapons when they committed their crimes. According to the police, roughly half gave fear of the death penalty as the reason for their decision to reject weapons."" The criminals who decided to not carry lethal weapons when they committed their crimes because of the fear of the death penalty. The threat of a possibility of being sentenced to death for crimes that a person commits proves that the death penalty may be cruel and unusual but very affective. Kronenwetter, Michael.

death penalty,"The death penalty is useless. It is morally wrong, inefficient, and observably ineffective in accomplishing several key goals. Historically, there have been five presumably legitimate purposes for punishment: (1) Retribution, (2) Deterrence, (3)Rehabilitation, (4)Incapacitation, and (5)Public Education. [1] For a punishment to be morally permitted, it must justify itself by fulfilling at least one of the aforementioned criteria. The death penalty is justified only under one criterion, and that criterion is not enough by itself to justify any punishment. (1) Retribution The death penalty does provide retribution. It provides retribution at a cost of an additional $90,000 per inmate on death row. [2] Life imprisonment is less costly, and an equally valid form of retribution. Even assuming that retribution is valid, the death penalty is still inefficient compared to life sentencing, an equally valid alternative. Where two processes are proposed to meet the same end, assuming the same result, the more efficient process should be favored. Life imprisonment and the death penalty both remove the freedom of an individual to act. One method is simply more costly and eliminates all of the offender's potential value. Therefore, the death penalty is the worse of two methods of accomplishing the same ends, and must be discredited under a theory of retribution. (2) Deterrence The death penalty does not deter. [3] (3) Rehabilitation The death penalty does not rehabilitate, obviously. (4) Incapacitation The death penalty does incapacitate. Incapacitation, however, is an invalid goal by itself. If incapacitation alone could justify the death penalty, then it would be proper to extend it to every instance of every criminal act ever conducted. After all, the argument goes, they wouldn't reoffend. Similarly, most people who argue for prison reform are concerned for rising costs. Life imprisonment is just as valid a form of incapacitation. It is also less costly. If incapacitation is the goal, then life imprisonment is still the better alternative. (5) Public Education If the death penalty does educate the public, it doesn't do it in the way it aims to. [4] [5] By increasing the incidence of homicide, the death penalty clearly could not accomplish its ends under this criterion. Conclusion The death penalty is therefore not justified. If the death penalty is not justified, it is the unjustified taking of another's life. The unjustified taking of another's life is murder. Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, the death penalty is morally wrong. The death penalty is therefore inefficient, ineffective and morally wrong. It should be discarded. Sources [1] http://www.wcl.american.edu...

death penalty,"First of all I would like to make my ""map points"" as to why I am oppose to the death penalty. 1. The cost One my argue by logic that the cost is much higher for life imprisonment because you would have to feed him everyday etc.... for the rest of their lives right. # A 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution (median cost $1.26 million). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration (median cost $740,000). (December 2003 Survey by the Kansas Legislative Post Audit) # In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment. (2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research) # In Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case. (Urban Institute, The Cost of the Death Penalty in Maryland, March 2008) # In California the current system costs $137 million per year; it would cost $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty. Innocence I will start off with a quote from Governor George Ryan of Illinois ""I cannot support a system which, in its administration, has proven so fraught with error and has come so close to the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life... Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate."" Since 1973, 130 people have been released from death rows throughout the country due to evidence of their wrongful convictions. In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row. 3. Death Penalty does not help anything There are no proven records that say that states that have the death penalty have lower crimes rates of any sort. People do not think right before they shot a guy in the face. ""Oh wait, this state has the death penalty"".

death penalty,"Opening Arguments : The system of law and order is all about justice but where do draw the line to were we become the very evil we wish to destroy. Murder is murder and capital punishment is just that murder, simple to just kill killers but what does that make you? It makes you a killer but with public opinion on your side and a notion of justice which isn't the case. Why is it that America holds a sanctity for life, and yet kill people for killing people how does that make sense its hypocritical. Case: 1. The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However it doesn't work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but then proven innocent after the sentence has already been carried out the government just goes oops sorry. 2. Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled ""Death Penalty and Sentencing Information,"" wrote: ""Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP.""

We can all agree that the death penalty (like a lethal shot) is much more humane than a public hanging, or even a private hanging for that matter. 2) Also, the death penalty is a much less costly way to deal with criminals than a life sentence.

death penalty,"There are many reasonable arguments against the death penalty. However, we are dealing with a life and death issue. When dealing with an issue of this magnitude I believe there should be great consequences. Statistics reveal that the death penalty is very costly. I think that when an issue regards human life all costs must be put aside. The actions that lead to the death penalty further justify the reason to put the aside the price. As a nation, the United States has a priority to stand by people and their rights. A nation that solely focuses on cost is a nation that does not have its priorities in line. Being a nation of the people, I think we must stand beside the victims and protect their violated rights. The 15th amendment states that ""no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"" (US Constitution). Simply, without the due process of law a person can not be deprived of their natural rights. This amendment stands alongside the victims. If a criminal is willing to interfere, break the law and deprive a person of their rights, I believe they should be punished to the maximum extent. If murderers do not value the rights of others, they should not be allowed to have those rights for themselves. Along with serving justice, the death penalty focuses on reasonable retribution. In order to be in consideration to earn the death penalty, a person must go to great measures to break laws. In the state of Texas to get the death penalty you must have committed a murder of a public officer, multiple persons, a person under 16 years of age and during a felony. Committing a murder in the first degree in Florida makes a person eligible for the penalty (Death Penalty Information Center). What it takes to be deserving of the punishment are the most ruthless and gruesome of crimes. The death penalty takes the lives of inhuman killers and law breakers. Not your everyday shoplifters and car thieves are prosecuted to receive the death penalty. Only the most extreme of criminals are eligible for the punishment. I believe that an extreme law breaker should be punished in an extreme manner. Jails and prisons are for people to be rehabilitated. Death is for those who commit the few and most dangerous of laws.",PRO,"The 15th amendment states that ""no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"" (US Constitution). ...

death penalty,"The idea that the death penalty is unjustified on lower crimes is not the topic of today's debate. The parameters set was the death penalty, which means that any strain of the death penalty can be defended. In this instance, murder/rape only is a reasonable standard to weigh the death penalty on. The claim made that someone was killed for being alone in a mall can be assumed to be either misinterpreted or false. Since my opponent does not mention a case, and since being alone in a mall is not a crime, that was obviously not the reason for the charge. My opponent also claims the death penalty increases the crime rate and cites the discovery channel. However, actual studies in the US, which due to their accuracy on US politics ought to be preferred, show that the death penalty is a DETERRENT for crime. (Ex:http://abc7news.com...) This is extremely important as it shows that the death penalty is not a way to seek revenge by the state, as stated by my opponent, but rather way to save net lives. I addressed this point in my last speech, but my opponent did not address it which means that it is still relevant in today's round. My opponent looks at conversion as the only evidence to claim that crime is reduced in nations without the death penalty. Yet, they offer no conversion rates or evidence for this beyond their own words.

""The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars"". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything some families struggle for, for free, and thats fair?

A death penalty is ""the punishment of execution, administered to someone legally convicted of a capital crime (1).""

death penalty,"I negate the resolution that the death penalty is a fair system of punishment. I negate the resolution based on the following [1]: 1.) The death penalty is applied in an unfair manner against United States citizens. 2.) The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars. 3.) Innocent people too often are executed. As I see it, my opponent's points as are as follows: 1.) A murderer should be rightly punished for his actions; the only way to do this is the death penalty. 2.) Death penalty is a painless and suffering-free way to die. 3.) Death penalties give the criminal enough time to get his affairs in order. 4.) There is no justice in allowing the murderer to live.

death penalty,"I deem the death penalty to be necessary. Morally, it is senseless that a serial killer would not face death as a punishment for their multiple crimes. Again, I could go into the devastational effects on the families of the victims, which harms many more people than it would the family of a serial killer, but you would argue I would be creating more pain by killing the killer. I cannot understand why a family would continue to support said killer, however it may happen. You have discounted economics and all other sensible retort I may have had, so it would be pointless me highlighting the economic benefits of the death penalty. You may personally be opposed to the death penalty, but, as is apparent in the Unite States, the people evidently want the death penalty, else they would proposition the banishment in their own state. Regardless if it actually deters crime or not, ""the majority"" want the death penalty: http://www.gallup.com... The above is only one example of a poll, and there are more to be found should you require . I concede that the Government has too many powers as it stands, however if they are to maintain any degree of PERCEPTION of justice, it would be a wise move to include the death penalty. Regardless of its effectiveness, it still puts the public mind at ease. All too commonly, we read comments in newspapers referencing the death penalty and the revival of it. To put my position bluntly, I will use an example. If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and letting them sizzle in 100 degree heat in the desert of Arizona, I would be opposed to the death penalty. However, this is NOT the case, most especially here in Britain. Some prisons are palatial. If the ""Arpaio model"" was adopted, I would deem that apt and just punishment, considering their life would be in more misery than if they were dead. That is certainly punishment in the true sense of the word. For as long as Britain continues to send prisoners to tax-funded 5* hotels, I deem the death penalty a worthy inclusion to the system.",PRO,"If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and",608
death penalty,"No problem. First of all I'll say while I do agree with the death penalty I think it should be very hard to be sentenced to. So imagine this. It is a summer night and your sleeping in bed with your wife and daughters downstairs. Someone breaks in and before you can do anything about it he has brutally slaughtered your wife and daughters. How could this man possibly just go to prison. He took innocent lives so why shouldn't a fair punishment for him be the death penalty. An eye for eye, right? I do realize many arguments against the death penalty are that what if an innocent was sentenced with a death penalty. While this is possible it is very rare. An innocent man has a better chance of being killed by a falling meteor. The death penalty offers more reward than risk. Also another thought is when someone doesn't get the death penalty there is a decent chance he will be out on the streets before he dies. Very few people serve a full life penalty. Would you really want to take a chance of this man being back on the streets someday?",PRO,It is a summer night and your sleeping in bed with your wife and daughters downstairs. ...

death penalty,"First I have to say sorry to my opponent for one missing the second round resulting in a forfeit. Second, for the lack of my free time I cannot give this argument my full effort, but will still try to convince the viewers of my position. 1) I agree that life imprisonment could easily be interpreted as cruel and unusual, however, with the death penalty, society focuses on vengeance and punishment, but with life imprisonment we can focus on rehabilitation and forgiveness. The death penalty gives the accused no chance of turning their life around, and is often sought out of vengeance of families of the victims, however the death penalty brings little to no closure of the families. These botched executions are unacceptable and because there is no humane method of killing, none shall be used. 2) As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. My opponent argues that trials shall be done faster and more efficiently, however that will just result in more mistakes, cause after all, we are all human, we all make mistakes, not just criminals. 3) I accept my opponent's argument that use of the death penalty doesn't correlate with murder rates, however I still state that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent. My opponent claims that more use of the death penalty would result in better deterrence, I admit this is possible, but it would not be a good thing for society, which is the original argument. An excessive use of the death penalty creates fear in society, which would be one method of deterrence, however with life imprisonment and the injection of morals into society. That way, society as a whole could get a better grasp on what is right and wrong. 4) Ok, all I have is one question: How many innocent people can be executed before the death penalty should stop being used? 5) The video doesn't relate to any one point, I feel that it helps express my overall feeling of the topic. http://www.youtube.com...",CON,"2) As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. ... http://www.youtube.com...",610
death penalty,"This is a debate concerning the death penalty and as the side arguing against it, I would like to make the following points: 1. The death penalty is costly When I say costly, I mean that according to NBC it costs about 1.7 million dollars to execute someone. New Jersey got rid of the death penalty because it costed 4 million dollars per inmate and they hadn't executed anyone since 1963. Plus, inmates staring into the face of the death penalty are entitled to two lawyers which could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars alone. 2. What if they're innocent The fact that the risk of ending the life of an innocent person should not be permitted, Killing an innocent person is morally reprehensible, so why should our justice system allow that possibility to exist? By eliminating the death penalty we eliminate any chance of this happening. 3. Does the death penalty deter crime ""There's no credible evidence of deterrence,"" concludes John Blume, a law professor with the Cornell Death Penalty Project. (Excerpt from the Denver Post). There's no way to tell if a murderer was aware of a state's death-penalty status when the crime was deliberated, or what impact the knowledge had. (also from the same article).

death penalty,"There are many ""crimes"" for which death penalty is applied that are not really high. For example, a woman was killed with death penalty in the United States just because she was alone in a mall. Do you think that just because this is prohibided it is a crime? No, it just a violation of laws in the country that she can correct with some time in the jail. With the death penalty many ""crimes"" like this are beeing punished. A discovery channel investigation shows that countries that alredy abolish death penalty have less criminals, because they have not any scare feelings about it. But some people are afraid of the jail and take out the idea of beeing criminals. How is death penalty not going to be the easy way if you think that the way of having less criminals is take them out of the world? The best way to stop it is to make them change and say sorry and if you try that, even if you don't achieve it, that will not be the easy way. Death penalty is a revenge. Let's suppose that a person violates someone and the victim kills him. Yu will clearly say that it is revenge, but if the government do the same, you will say that not. Human rights are equal for EVERYONE, even if the government is superior, they have to respect human rights of everyone, can not decide what to do with the life of people and can't take revenge replacing another person just because they are superior. If death penalty really helps, why does the countries that alredy abolish it have less criminals? Take the example of Donald Calloway. He was a criminal since he was 15 years old. he scaped from the jail. In a moment when he transformed to catholic religion, he say sorry to God and cry for his criminal acts.

So, if you are against this argument, you are basically costing the ordinary joe more money to keep killers and and cold-blooded murderers alive. People are paying for criminals' food and water. With the death penalty, we are getting rid of the very worst criminals and doing it in a humane way. If we do not give murderers the death penalty, they are free to live and if they are nice enough and say that they have changed they have a chance to get out of jail and walk the streets again.

People would be SAVING money, especially tax payers, so YOU would be saving money if the death penalty is abolished. Then, you can use that money to pay for making more prisons to contain the criminals. That would not nearly cost as much as these executions would. Once again, 1/7 people are innocent who are sentenced to death. That is an unsettling number, for a country which wants to be fair and serve true justice. Even though they are criminals, they still have families who love and care about them. What makes it fair to make their families' suffer when they are innocent people? That does not make sense either. Statistics have failed to prove that the death penalty deteriorates murder or crime.

The death penalty is a way of making the world a safer place and it is arguably a self-defense claim.

They chose to accept that consequence when they chose to commit the crime. If the government does not administer those consequences, then the result would be a higher number of crimes that are punishable by death. 3. My religious reason for supporting the death penalty is this: The Lord told Nephi in the Book of Mormon to kill Laban because it was better for one wicked man to die than for an entire nation to dwindle in unbelief. I compare this to how the death penalty, or the death of one wicked man, keeps this nation from finding murder, rape, and other crimes punishable by death morally acceptable.",PRO,"If the government does not administer those consequences, then the result would be a higher number of crimes that are punishable by death. ...

""The Deterrent Effect"" Like I previously wrote the Death Penalty does NOT deter crime. ""One argument for the death penalty is that it is a strong deterrent to murder and other violent crimes. In fact, evidence shows just the opposite. The homicide rate is at least five times greater in the United States than in any Western European country, all without the death penalty. Southern states carry out more than 80 percent of the executions but have a higher murder rate than any other region. Texas has by far the most executions, but its homicide rate is twice that of Wisconsin, the first state to abolish the death penalty. Look at similar adjacent states: There are more capital crimes in South Dakota, Connecticut and Virginia (with death sentences) than neighboring North Dakota, Massachusetts and West Virginia (without death penalties). Furthermore, there has never been any evidence that the death penalty reduces capital crimes or that crimes increased when executions stopped..."" Just because something is supposed to deter another thing it won't always work, like an untested vaccine. Here in Canada we have no death penalty and and almost no crime. ""Repeated Murders"" I get what you are saying but if someone has committed a crime so bad that they get the death penalty chances are they won't be released. Also there is a huge risk of innocence. ""The wrongful execution of an innocent person is an injustice that can never be rectified. Since the reinstatement of the death penalty, 142 men and women have been released from Death Row nationally....some only minutes away from execution. Moreover, in the past two years evidence has come to light which indicates that four men may have been wrongfully EXECUTED in recent years for crimes they did not commit.

death penalty,"First, I would like to say good luck to my opponent. To begin, I want to stress the fact that the death penalty is morally wrong. Why does the government say killing is wrong but goes ahead and does it anyway? We are taught that killing is wrong, and it should extend here too. from www.odap.org: There is a better alternative: life without parole. In Oregon, we have the option of sentencing convicted murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole. There are currently over 121 people in Oregon who have received this sentence. The death penalty puts innocent lives at risk. Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in the United States in 1976, 138 innocent men and women have been released from death row, including some who came within minutes of execution. In Missouri, Texas and Virginia investigations have been opened to determine if those states executed innocent men. To execute an innocent person is morally reprehensible; this is a risk we cannot take. Race and place determine who lives and who dies. Those who kill whites are more likely to be sentenced to die than those who kill African-Americans. In Oregon, prosecutors from some counties are more likely to pursue the death penalty than others are. We pay many millions for the death penalty system. According to the Oregonian, in 1995 the trials for three Washington County murder cases cost more than $1.5 million. One was sentenced to death. The two others, one of whom was found guilty of four murders, are not on death row. In 2000 a fiscal impact summary from the Oregon Department of Administrative Services stated that the Oregon Judicial Department alone would save $2.3 million annually if the death penalty were eliminated. It is estimated that total prosecution and defense costs to the state and counties equal $9 million per year. This shows at least four reasons why the death penalty is wrong. We pay more, we get nothing out of it, and there are essentially no consequences (other than death) for the perpetrator.",CON,"First, I would like to say good luck to my opponent.  ...

death penalty,"C1: The right to life “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men” As quoted above, The general consensus in the U.S. is that the primary function of government is to secure people’s rights. Some of which are unalienable. In the United States, life is considered an unalienable right. This is evident by the quote above taken from the Declaration of Independence. How is it that the State can function as a securer of the individual right to life while simultaneously taking a person’s life? Simply put, it cannot. The State does have the right to remove those who violate other’s rights from society. However, the State has no legitimate cause to take away one’s unalienable right to life. This is true even for the worst individuals imaginable. For the State to take one’s life via capital punishment is for the State to function contrary to its primary purpose. Life as a right should remain unalienable. C2: Innocents At least 18 people have been wrongly executed. 18 people have had their unalienable right to life taken from them unjustly. (1) What cost is my opponent willing to pay for so called justice that she is willing to endorse the unjust action of the state taking people’s lives. C3: Cost Trying a death penalty case and the process of carrying it out cost significantly more than life in prison. (2) “the enhanced cost of trying a death penalty case is at least $1.25 million more than trying a comparable murder case resulting in a sentence of life in prison without parole.” (3) C4: A reasonable alternative “In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The sentence is cheaper to tax-payers and keeps violent offenders off the streets for good. Unlike the death penalty, a sentence of Life Without Parole also allows mistakes to be corrected.” (4) Overview: The Death Penalty is more expensive than the alternative. Innocent people have been and likely will be executed. The States involvement in the death penalty is contrary to the purpose of government and infringes on unalienable rights. Life in prison without parole is a reasonable, cost effective alternative to the death penalty that gives the desired result without the potential harm the Death Penalty does. Due to the inherent harm of the death penalty and reasonable alternatives, the Death penalty should be abolished. Sources (1) http://www.deathpenalty.org... (2) http://www.forbes.com...

death penalty,"I will be proposing four reasons why the Death Penalty should not be utilized in the United States. Human Error Humans make mistakes, so it is very possible that the wrong person could get persecuted for a crime. There are many reasons that there would be an error in picking the correct person. There is a lot of pressure put upon persecutors by the community when there is a particularly brutal crime, such as a rape/murder. The increased pressure can cause the prosecutor to make hasty decisions when deciding the verdict so as to appease the need for justice, which can result in the wrong person being put on death row.[1] Putting someone completely innocent to death is a risk that cannot be taken. Lack of Deterrence The threat of the death penalty does not often stop people from committing the crimes that could get them put on death row. People who are in a fit of fear or rage, under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, or have a mental disability which causes them to commit the crime are very unlikely to think about the possibility of being executed.[2] As recent as 2011, the murder rate has actually been higher in states that utilized the death penalty.[3] This shows a lack of the death penalty actually deterring crimes, which defeats one of it's main purposes. Cost The procedures and trials that must take place in a death penalty case take longer, and are therefore more costly than the average life without parole (LWOP) case. For example, in Colorado, it takes six times more days to settle a capital case than a LWOP case.[4] That, in turn, causes the price to be exponentially higher. The average cost for a federal case in which the death penalty is being sought is $620,932. That is about eight times more expensive than the average federal case where the death penalty is not an element.[4] Though the means of carrying out the execution itself can be considered reasonably priced, the procedures that precede the execution are very expensive. Hypocrisy People may see it fit that someone who killed someone should be killed, but wouldn't that mean that the person who carried out the execution of the guilty party deserves to be killed as well? The argument, “an eye for an eye” seems like it makes sense, but in reality, the people carrying out the death penalty would be no better than the person who was executed. It is hypocritical to punish someone for murder by killing them. The death penalty contradicts its motives. Sources: [1]http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

In a case where the death penalty is carried out, the penalty can never be reversed. 2. The death penalty is murder. Murder is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as ""the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought."" Therefore, the only difference between murder and capital punishment is the term ""unlawfully."" The punishment itself is the crime that it is being used to punish people for. 3. Advocates of the death penalty sometimes cite the deterrent effect of the death penalty, but I challenge anyone to find reliable evidence to support this. The types of crimes committed which are punished by the death penalty cannot be deterred. A murder can be a crime of passion, in which case it cannot be deterred because it is impulsive. A person who commits a murder in the heat of the moment does not think about consequences. A murderer could also be motivated by profit. A criminal of this type almost always operates under the assumption that he or she will not be caught. If you don't think you'll be caught, they are unlikely to seriously consider the consequences. In general, the type of criminal that commits a murder is not deterred as easily as other criminals and ordinary citizens.",CON,"Therefore, the only difference between murder and capital punishment is the term ""unlawfully."" ...

death penalty,"Firstly, your response included no factual date to support your claim that ""feeding an housing and heating and cooling those institutions that are already quite crowded is going to cost even more money."" According to the L.A. Times, ""the California death penalty system costs taxpayers $114 million per year beyond the costs of keeping convicts locked up for life. Taxpayers have paid more than $250 million for each of the state's execution."" This quotation is factual proof that the death penalty is far more expensive than keeping someone incarcerated for a life term. Secondly, their is no doubt that they're exists people who are considered extremely dangerous, but who can be kept incarcerated and away from the general population. When imposing the death penalty, we run the risk of executing an innocent person, which is truly an irreversible mistake. A clear example of this statement is the execution of Jessee Tafero. After Mr. Tafero was executed, while his Writ of Habeas Corpus was pending, doubts arose as to his involvement in the murder of two polices officers. Mr. Tafero was convicted by an over zealous Judge who had a strong belief in the death penalty. Ultimately, Mr. Tafero's Co-Defendant was released from prison while Mr. Tafero was wrongly executed by means of the electric chair. According to US Senator Russ Feingold, ""Since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 87 people have been freed from death row because they were later proven innocent"". The fact that these people were on Death Row is troubling, given that they were innocent and could have been wrongfully executed. Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun states ""rather than continue to coddle the court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved...I feel...obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed.""

death penalty,"I would like to thank my opponent for her accpetance, now on with the debate. Case I will be affirming the resolution that the death penalty is justified and that it should be kept as a punishment. My next contentions will show why it is a good form of punishment. Contention 1: Just must be served. My first point will be that justice must be served. The death penalty is only reserved for those who commit a act of murder. It is crucial that in a just society, the punishment must fit the crime. If a person violates another person's right to life, then justice demands that the violator's right to life be violated. Contention 2: The death penalty works as deterent. People who love their lives will not do anything to put it in jeperdy. So, sense murder ia a crime that is punishable by death, people will not murder. A great example would be Japan. They have the death penalty, and also have the lowest murder rate of anyother advanced country in the world [1]. Contention 3: The death penalty saves the lives of innocent people. The death penalty can and has saved tons of innocent lives. Studies have shown that in the U.S. 1.2% of offenders who committed murder were arrested within 3 years of being realeased because they murdered another person [2]. The number must become a zero. How do we do this? The death penalty, because it is the only way to make sure that the killers wont kill again. Conclusion Due to the fact that if a person kills a person then they themselves must also be killed, and that puting the murderer to death is the only way to make sure they do not murder anymore, it is just too make it a punishment whereever it is not.

death penalty,"I want to thank my partner for presenting this debate. Considering the very stern time limits, I will resort to re-using some of my old talking points. Please forgive my lack of creativity. The death penalty cannot be trusted to be inerrant; because it will always be administered by imperfect humans. Humans make mistakes. Among these mistakes cannot be the accidental killing of innocents - brought about by our allowing ourselves to become destabilized by rage. It must be a hard and fast rule that our society and culture do not accept the killing of innocents - even if we are quite certain that we aren't doing so. We are human, and we make mistakes. These mistakes are bound to occur, inevitable, and so we must not apply fallible human understanding to this irreparable and irreversible act. My concern is whether or not maintaining the death penalty is safe to operate – for law abiding citizens who must live nearby such a system. I have shown examples of how it is not. Further, I am not convinced that it can ever be corrected and reformed to offer society the assurance that innocent persons will not suffer death or the loss of loved friends and family as a result of operating the death penalty. I maintain that the failure rate of the death penalty safeguards, if applied to a private company or even an entire industry, would be unacceptable to the public. I argue that rage is the main motivator, the main “selling point” for the death penalty industry – but that this is inadequate to justify allowing it to continue to operate. “I was mad at a serial killer, so I killed your little brother, who did not do anything wrong, but I still want to keep killing serial killers, so I will continue accidentally killing little brothers in order to get revenge on serial killers” is simply not a valid argument. On the other hand, the same argument that suggests that it is unsafe for society to allow serial killers to be paroled due to the possibility that these offenders may kill an innocent person - is exactly my argument against the death penalty: it kills people who do not deserve to die. My argument, therefore: 1. The death penalty is unsafe for the law-abiding public, due to inevitable mistakes made by the penal system 2. The death penalty is irreversible, mistakes cannot be corrected 3. The fact that our society will ineveitably kill innocent persons as we make use of the death penalty is unacceptable",CON,"I argue that rage is the main motivator, the main “selling point” for the death penalty industry – but that this is inadequate to justify allowing it to continue to operate. ... “I was mad at a serial killer, so I killed your",630
death penalty,"The death penalty is designed to be a punishment for heinous crimes and represents somewhat of an ""eye for an eye"" approach to sentencing. In theory, this seems fair at the outset but if we really address the goal of punishment, I maintain that the death penalty is not effective in reaching this goal and instead represents one of the greatest potential injustices that could occur. The goals of punishment are primarily a) to impose some responsibilty for someone's actions upon them (the criminal) and b) to deter future similar action from that person and from other members of society. The death penalty does address the first point. The person who presumably killed multiple people will then bear the responsibility of dying for their actions. But, do they really pay a price? Often, these are people who may have had no real desire to live in the first place. More important is the second point. Those people that are willing to commit a heinous crime are not afraid to die. Killing them really does not cause them to suffer nearly as much as a lifetime in prison might. Thus, the idea of a death penalty for their actions is probably not enough to deter people that commit heinous crimes from committing heinous crimes. This brings me to the greatest injustice that could possibly happen because of the death penalty: the execution of an innocent person. The sole reason the death penalty should not exist is because there is the possibility we may be executing an innocent person. Juries have absolutely made this mistake before. The execution of even one innocent person, no matter how many people were guilty that were executed, would represent the greatest tragedy we could have our government bestow upon its own people. People are not infallible enough to be making such judgments upon other human beings. And, I think if you have ever done jury duty, you will immediately doubt how well trained our jurors are to be making such life and death decisions. In summation, the death penalty is fair in terms of retribution, but it does not deter capital offenses and it is far too risky because of the potential for human error.",CON,"Killing them really does not cause them to suffer nearly as much as a lifetime in prison might. ...

death penalty,"Well, I'd like to thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate. Before I get started outlining my argument (since Swagjake has only barely started with his own, I will do the same), I'd like to clarify the debate, since i do think it's unclear from the information given. What are we talking about? We're discussing the death penalty, and likely focusing on the United States in its usage. This is a policy of capital punishment, or ""a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime.""

I would contend that that's not anywhere near the reality, though I would rather he explained that argument (and, preferably, sourced it) before I rebut it. My argument will come down to 3 basic points, each of which will then be expanded upon in subpoints.

death penalty,"There is nothing wrong with the death penalty because it is almost exclusively for the offense of murder. Except when it turns out that the person executed was innocent. That has happened multiple times bringing me to my first point. POINT 1 Death is a very final thing and sometimes people are executed and then later, evidence is found of their innocence. You can't bring a dead person back to life. So there are innocent people who are executed; if it was life in prison than when that evidence of their innocence is found they can be let out. Some examples: http://en.wikipedia.org... POINT 2 There are things way worse than the death penalty; namely life in prison. People who are sent to prison for life will experience large amounts of psychological trauma; if you subscribe to the Eye for an Eye philosophy or believe that they should be tortured, then life in prison would be much better than the death penalty. POINT 3 The death penalty costs a lot more than any other form of punishment; even more than keeping them alive in prison. That's because of all the appeals they have to go through in addition to keeping them alive in prison on the death row.

There are other alternatives to the death penalty where the criminal would be in just as much pain. ""Instead of using the death penalty to express society's rage at wanton murder, we would be better off forcing remorseless and callous criminals to confront their depravity and make them realize how much pain they cause to others"" (Williams 45).

death penalty,"I am very much against the death penalty. I have this stand on this issue for the following reasons. The United States is already over $1 trillion in debt, so we do not need to contribute to that amount with granting death penalty to criminals. According to editor of The Death Penalty, William Dudley, ""In a study done in North Carolina, the death penalty costs them $2.16 million more than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. In Texas, the death penalty costs around $2.3 million, nearly three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a maximum security jail for forty years"" (Dudley 38). The death penalty is a very costly punishment compared to keeping criminals in jail, and is granted quite often and contributes to the amount of debt of the United States. In fact, the death penalty does not deter (prevent) any future crimes from happening. ""In one study done in Oklahoma, it was found that after Oklahoma resumed capital punishment no deterrent effect was found-- in fact, a brutalization effect (increase in homicides) was reported"" (Dudley 40). This proves that capital punishment does not lower crime rates-- in this case, it increased them. Life in prison guarantees no future crimes; therefore, I think, we should not waste the money on murdering criminals when granting them a life sentence in prison would do the same job at a much less cost.",CON,"The United States is already over $1 trillion in debt, so we do not need to contribute to that amount with granting death penalty to criminals. ...

The majority of those costs occur at the trial level. (Duke University, May 1993). e) Enforcing the death penalty costs Florida $51 million a year above what it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison without parole.

From an economic viewpoint, this form of punishment is far superior to any other form of criminal punishment.The penalty does not have to be an expensive form of intoxication or electric chair or anything of that nature. Instead, a simple bullet to the head would do the trick. Conversely, the cost of a life sentence or even several years in prison would cost far more than a simple bullet. Speaking in numbers, each bullet round costs around 21 cents (based on The Last Word) which is way lower than the millions spent on prison sentences. Moral and Ethical Values By giving a short quick death, we preserve our humanity. The Death Penalty provides this kind of treatment. Compared to the years or months in jail time, the time spent for a short kill will be far less painful in terms of time spent suffering.

death penalty,"I thank my opponent for setting up this debate. Good luck to both of us! Firstly, my opponent makes a point that the death penalty can deter people from committing certain crimes. While this may be true for some people it may be different for others. For some people death may be just an easy way out. The thought of being subject to harsh penalties while alive is plenty of deterrence for most people. Many police chiefs have confirmed this that the death penalty offers little deterrence. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... Next, there are some points about how the death penalty should only be used in certain circumstances with murder NOT being one of them. However, among many circles, murder is usually considered the worst crime and the death penalty the worst punishment. Using this logic shouldn't the worst crime be punished with the worst penalty? However, as I'm arguing con in this debate I'll stay away from that. My opponent mentions how a fraudster would be deter from committing their crime at the threat of death. If a fraudster spent years obtaining large amounts of money only to be imprisoned later wouldn't it make them feel like their entire life was wasted? By that point they would feel all that time was wasted as the money would no longer be significant to them. As for the death penalty for burning down a library, this isn't fully justified. If all the books burned we could just reproduce them from other copies of the same book. I doubt there is any significant work of literature where only one copy exists. If the book was important there would be other copies produced. Plus burning down a library would also destroy books that are insignificant like Twilight(lol). As for poaching and other such crimes, if we as humans regard murder as a horrible crime wouldn't it be double standards to murder a person for murdering somebody or poaching? Killing is unethical regardless of who is doing it. I'll like to keep things brief this round. Good luck to my opponent! :)",CON,"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

death penalty,"Death Penalty Isn't Costly In my opponents opening argument he argues that the Death Penalty is costly to even use. It actually isn't, but the system needs to be adjusted for it to be more economically beneficial. The main issue that makes it seem like its costly is the portion called ""Death Row"". Death Row is the time a criminal waits until they are executed, and can either be very short or very long (1). The fact is that the length before someone gets executed can be depicted withis the following graph. That's a long time, especially for an average person on Death Row. And with this comes the cost of keeping that person within the cells. The fact is, it isn't the actual procedure that costs alot; it's keeping the prisoner alive within the cells (2). My solution is shorten the Death Row so the benfits can be recieved. According to David Muhlhansen: The Death Penalty can deter crime as well as economically benefit society if Death Row is shorten, instead of dragging it out for a long time (3). 2. Innocence My opponent then brings up another common argument for being against the Death Penalty about the possibility of innocence I will argue that the chance of innocence is so low that it will not be a huge factor within the system. In fact, there is only a 1 in 25 chance that someone executed is innocent (4). That number is pretty low, and really not to impactful. I like to compare this same scenario as getting ran over by a car. Does it stink? Yes, but stuff happens. Just because one car killed one innocent bistander does not mean that society should ban cars now. Stuff happens, and we move on; and the same can be said about the Death Penalty.

death penalty,"Common sense, lately bolstered by statistics, tells us that the death penalty will deter murder. People fear nothing more than death. Therefore, nothing will deter a criminal more than the fear of death. Life in prison is less feared. Murderers clearly prefer it to execution otherwise, they would not try to be sentenced to life in prison instead of death. Therefore, a life sentence must be less deterrent than a death sentence. And we must execute murderers as long as it is merely possible that their execution protects citizens from future murder. Society is justly ordered when each person receives what is due to him. Crime disturbs this just order, for the criminal takes from people their lives, peace, liberties, and worldly goods in order to give himself undeserved benefits. Deserved punishment protects society morally by restoring this just order, making the wrongdoer pay a price equivalent to the harm he has done. This is retribution, not to be confused with revenge, which is guided by a different motive. In retribution the spur is the virtue of indignation, which answers injury with injury for public good. Retribution is the primary purpose of just punishment as such. Rehabilitation, protection, and deterrence have a lesser status in punishment than retribution. No system of justice can produce results which are 100% certain all the time. Mistakes will be made in any system which relies upon human testimony for proof. We should be vigilant to uncover and avoid such mistakes. Our system of justice rightfully demands a higher standard for death penalty cases. However, the risk of making a mistake with the extraordinary due process applied in death penalty cases is very small, and there is no credible evidence to show that any innocent persons have been executed at least since the death penalty was reactivated in 1976. The inevitability of a mistake should not serve as grounds to eliminate the death penalty any more than the risk of having a fatal wreck should make automobiles illegal.",PRO,"Murderers clearly prefer it to execution otherwise, they would not try to be sentenced to life in prison instead of death. ...

death penalty,"To keep things simple, death penalty is to be taken in the usual sense of term i.e. debt is payed(punishment) through execution(big tyrion lannister fan). Now, when we are talking about death penalty, we are talking about death penalty in the extremest of the extreme crimes, crimes which take away human dignity and/or an integral human right to such an extent that they deserve the most extreme form of punishment permissible by the state(or any other ruling authority, as the case maybe). To give some context to the above mentioned model, we are talking about crimes like rape, murder etc. Let us get one thing straight before moving forward with this debate that when we are talking about death penalty in a case, the facts of the case are as such, that it has been established that the crime committed deserves the highest level of punishment, only thing in question in this debate is whether death penalty should be the highest form of penalty there is or not. Now that we are clear to as to what this debate is to be about, let us move forward to the contentions provided by me in the favor of death penalty Contention 1 When we are talking about death penalty, we are talking about it in the extremest of the extreme crime, these crimes by their very nature are so heinous that we believe they are irredeemable and hence the committers of such crimes should be executed. Now, the reasons we believe these crimes are irredeemable is firstly, the heinousity of the crime committed makes mercy an option that""s out of the window, why it makes mercy an inconsiderable option is because such offenders shouldn""t be tolerated in the society(because of the gravity of the crime commited) and by keeping them in prison we are still tolerating them in the society, as prison might be an excluded part of the society but it is part of the society still. Secondly, Prison is ran through taxpayers money, and the purpose behind taxpayer""s money is welfare of the society and it is ridiculous to spend even a single penny of taxpayer""s honest money to shelter or feed murderers and rapists, as no probable welfare can come out of it. Contention 2 Prison is a place ran by the state, through tax payers money, now as already mentioned above, taxpayer""s money is to be used for the purposes of welfare, and such is the case even in the case of such money being spent in prison. Execution of these inhuman elements will make the prison life, much more up to the desired standard. Why the prison life needs to be up to a desired standards is because, a crime committed in prison is a crime still. Cases of prison rape and murder will come shooting down if the murderers and rapists were not a part of the prison system altogether.",PRO,"Now, the reasons we believe these crimes are irredeemable is firstly, the heinousity of the crime committed makes mercy an option that""s out of the window, why it makes mercy an inconsiderable option is because such offenders",655
death penalty,"To answer my opponents question, yes I am American; but that should not matter with this debate. My opponent brought up a statistic about the U.S being the highest prison population around the world. I will agree that the number needs to be reduced, but there are other ways to reduce that number besides the Death Penalty. The number of prisoners is mainly because of the amount of drug busts made for individuals having an ounce of marijuana. To support this claim, stated under ""Almost Half Of Federal Prisoners Held For Drug Crimes"" (1), it states: ""Although the overall U.S. prison population declined slightly in 2011, the federal prison population continued to rise, with rates of drug and immigration offenders that eclipse those held for violent crimes. While only 8 percent of federal prisoners were sentenced for violent crimes in 2011, almost half of federal inmates – 48 percent – were in prison for drug crimes"". I am for the Death Penalty for Murderers and Rapists, but not for simple drug usage. Focusing on the topic though, the reason why we need the Death Penalty is to gain a profit from it and deter crime. How my opponent may ask? The system known as ""Death Row"" needs to be tweaked to gain the benefits of the Death Penalty. Voters, Death Row is simply the inmates who wait in a certain cell until their execution take place. After the criminal is sentenced to Death Penalty, instead of a more instantaneous death; it is a long drawn process of trying to prove that the criminal isn't guilt even though most of the time, they are. With the tweaking of Death Row, by making it more instant, we will actually save money from paying taxes to waiting inmates about to come into death (2). Also it will deter crime because stated under ""Do More Executions mean Fewer Murders"" (3), it states: ""What gets little notice, however, is a series of academic studies over the past half-dozen years that claim to settle a once hotly debated argument: whether the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder. The analyses say yes. They count between three and 18 lives that would be saved by the execution of each convicted killer"". They once more refer back to the issue of Death Row, and if it was fixed; the results would be more easily noticable. I wait for my opponents argument.

death penalty,"Cost In terms of the cost of a prisoner for life without parole, versus a death penalty prisoner you have to look at multiple factors. According to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, it takes 10.60 years for a death penalty inmate to be executed. It also costs on average $90,000 more, per year to maintain a death row inmate. Adding together all the costs of lawyers, and other legal issues, a death row inmate can easily cost more than a lifelong inmate. By stopping the death penalty in the United States, it is estimated to save the government from $1-2 billion per year.

death penalty,"Although some parts of the death penalty can be unsettling to people, the fact of the matter is the death penalty actually saves net lives. In order for a government to govern effectively, it needs to be Utilitarian in its approach. Therefore, from the government's stance, as long as at least two lives are saved by killing one person, the action is good in the eyes of the government. According to a study done y Emory University, 18 lives are saved with each execution, and 18 lives are lost for each sentence commuted. Even life in prison resulted in the same 18 homicides. Therefore, from a practical and governing standpoint, the death penalty is not only justified, but good. The system that you propose with the cameras and alerts is an extremely slippery slope. A real world parallel would be something like the PATRIOT act, or in other words, a surveillance state. This is one of the worst forms of governments, as rights are stripped to defend security and the government inevitably becomes a regime. The religious argument is irrelevant. There is no study that claims death penalty sentences reduce conversions, and in fact, because of Pascal's Wager, it would make more sense for death penalty sentences to convince people to convert. In fact, the argument you make throughout the rest of your case is refuted by the existence of a God, since Heaven is infinitely better than the Earth, and Hell is infinitely bad. This dichotomy is in fact made better, since Pascal's Wager would allow more people to go Heaven. As you claim, ""Never good to take the easy way,"" the easy way is to in fact let them rot in a prison instead of facing divine judgement.

This however, is also easily resolved by a prison sentence, so surely if a prison sentence can achieve the same as what a death penalty can, for a lower cost, why is it not more effective to simply use that method. Many people would find that being locked in a small room, with limited contact with the outside world, more repulsing than a relatively quick and painless death. If someone has done something wrong (in the case of the death penalty, murder) it is right in the eyes of most people that justice should be applied. However, is the death penalty justice, or revenge? Justice has two definitions, according the the Oxford English dictionary, (http://oxforddictionaries.com...), and neither involves anything about killing people. The first definition, which is actually where the second definition originates, says, if you have not already read it, ""Just behaviour or treatment"". In my opinion, doing something to somebody that is what they have done to somebody else is not acceptable behaviour, especially in modern society. If somebody is accused of burglary, they are not burgled themselves. The same goes for (in the majority of HEDCs) sexual assault, trespassing or assault, amongst every other crime recognised by the law. While I understand that murder is much more serious, surely the same rule applies? Another thing that should be taken into consideration is the message that is given off; most HEDCs around the world do not use the death penalty, such as in Europe -where only Belarus maintains the death penalty- has less murders per 100,000 inhabitants than areas in Africa that maintain it. The comparison can be made using the graph on this page: (http://fullfact.org...). The article reveals a lot as well. While the murder rates would be higher in some countries due to culture or poor application of law, countries that have the death penalty also often have a high murder rate, so it obviously does not act as a deterrent.",CON,"This however, is also easily resolved by a prison sentence, so surely if a prison sentence can achieve the same as what a death penalty can, for a lower cost, why is it not more effective to simply use that method. ...

death penalty,"My opponent has forfeited the round. However i will still give my arguments. In this round, my burden will be that the Death penalty is not an acceptable form of punishment, and i must provide an alternate solution. My solution for the round will be simple. A life sentence. Although this is already implemented. I believe that it should always be picked over the death penalty. I will provide 3 key arguments in regards to this alternative. C1: Death penalty does not provide an adequate punishment for the crime(s) a criminal has committed. The death penalty offers an easy way out. We must weigh the punishment with the act committed. If someone takes the life of someone else or multiple people, is it less of a punishment to kill them off immediately. You only end all of their stress, and worries. By giving a convict the death penalty, you give them the proper punishment for the heinous crime that the convict has committed. It is much harder on the convict and a much more suitable compensation to give them a life sentence. C2: The death penalties expense is costly to the US economy. Samson in 09 continues The death penalty is much more expensive than life without parole because the Constitution requires a long and complex judicial process for capital cases. This process is needed in order to ensure that innocent men and woman are not executed for crimes they did not commit, and even with these protections the risk of executing an innocent person can not be completely eliminated. If the death penalty was replaced with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole*, which costs millions less and also ensures that the public is protected while eliminating the risk of an irreversible mistake, the money saved could be spent on programs that actually improve the communities in which we live. The millions of dollars in savings could be spent on: education, roads, police officers and public safety programs, after-school programs, drug and alcohol treatment, child abuse prevention programs, mental health services, and services for crime victims and their families.

I agree some people who commit these crimes have no morals, but some of them also have been through something traumatic or may have a mental condition. Killing them still isn't the answer. If installing the death penalty will ensure that these crimes aren't committed, and by the same offender, then why does the recidivism rate remain high? The death penalty is permitted in the US.

Most people fear death and strive to avoid it; death is the consequence of heinous crimes; therefore, most people would refrain from heinous crimes. This saves innocent lives and decreases crime. 2. The death penalty accelerates criminal cases. The threat of using the death penalty quickly can help solve cases. 3. More people support the death penalty than oppose it. A majority of the people supports capital punishment and vote for those politicians that take a strong stand against crime. Four. The death penalty is just. Our moral status as human beings allows us to deliberate about moral significant actions and consequences. When someone steals an old lady's purse, for example, we feel a moral outrage at the incident. This is called, ""moral aggression."" Our moral aggression obligates us to use retributive justice in response to heinous, violent crimes. Therefore, the concept of justice is achieved and upheld by sustaining the death penalty. Five. Without penalties for crime, misconduct, and rule breaking chaos would occur. My opponent will have to argue that anarchism is okay, and that people would be incapable of retaliatory tactics when they are raped, their family is murdered, and when their chattle is thieved away. If the car you desperately wanted was sitting in a parking lot running without an occupant, and there was no penalty for stealing it, would you steal it? Most likely, yes. For most actions, there is a risk and a reward. If I want to rape a young boy, my reward is sex and the risk is many years in prison. Depriving the natural order of justice in this manner results in chaos: absolutely obliterated economic systems; skyrocketing theft, murder, rape, and rights infringement; starvation, die-offs, and environmental mayhem; sports would cease to function properly; violence would escalate; family relations and social relations would deteriorate.

death penalty,"I do acknowledge that mistakes are rarely made, and -as you said- most people on death row 'deserve' to be there. However, I must disagree with your argument about prison. Prisoners are not just subjected to uncomfortably, as was suggested, but attempts are made to 'correct' them are made (despite the fact that they rarely work) and, most importantly, are kept away from society which is the intended cause of the death penalty anyway. While I understand it is not am ideal system, and many governments refuse to give out actual life sentences, it is still a better system in terms of cost (especially court costs), the severity of mistakes and possibly less people would be willing to commit murder; to some, a quick death may not be that much a daunting prospect, but spending long years locked up is a much more severe punishment. The links in my previous arguments show that, in many cases, the death penalty is not a deterrent, and people don't care or worry about it. If you look at the USA's crime rate for murders by state, states with the death penalty, generally speaking, have a higher murder rate than states without it (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...). Obviously then, the death penalty rarely acts as a deterrent. If it does not act as a deterrent, is more expensive, has the possibility of murdering innocent people and is a more inhumane way of dealing with people, why is it still applied? Killing someone who murders in the name of justice, surely contradicts the entire point of it? While I understand that the murderer is guilty of a crime that deserves to be punished, is killing them really justice, or is it just revenge? The small amount of benefits of the death penalty compared to the prison sentence, that is better in most factors, would suggest that it is. If someone is wrongly killed, and later found to be innocent, should the court and everybody else who was responsible for the death of this person be killed as well? Even if it is different to killing somebody in first degree murder, surely directly killing an innocent person should not be tolerated. To summarise, I am against the death penalty because: It does not work as a deterrent (generally speaking), there is a risk of murdering an innocent person, there are other ways of dealing with criminals that offer larger benefits, it is expensive and it is not necessary in the modern world.

death penalty,"Thanks for the quick response Pro. Since my opponent has not posted any points for his side, and only posted rebuttals against my side, my following arguments will only consist of counter-rebuttals. Deterrence, Counter My opponent states here that based on an assumption we can justify the death penalty. He seems to support this with the idea that there is no evidence to show that the death penalty doesn't deter. However I disagree, the fact that there is no evidence the death penalty deters is clear evidence that the death penalty doesn't deter crime. Until it can be statistically shown that the death penalty saves lives, we as a society cannot allow and cannot justify its continuation. A Moral Argument, Counter I've already explained my viewpoint, and really our two mentalities are matters of opinion, so all I can say is that it's up to the readers to decide which they agree with more. ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" Mahatma Ghandi.[1] Getting the Wrong Guy, Counter My opponent doesn't think innocents are wrongfully executed anymore, but his claims are un-sourced, and thus un-provable to the readers. Price, Counter My opponent justifies the death penalty's excessive cost by saying the responsibility of the price is on the people who set the prices, not us who decide to keep killing criminals. Certainly, average people like you and me didn't set the price, but that shouldn't completely eliminate our accountability.

death penalty,"I agree with the rules but don't copy pasta tons of stuff, cite it. The overarching reason why capital punishment should not be allowed is due to the fact that it is just unnecessary. Point 1: The death penalty is NOT a deterrent. For example, in 1976 there were 0 accounts of the death penalty being issued and the murder rate was 8.8. Now we jump ahead to 1979. There were 2 accounts of the death penalty and the murder rate was 9.7. (These are ratios) Moving ahead to 1990. 23 executions and a 9.4 murder rate and so on and so forth. (ACLU #1) I could go on but I feel I have made my point regarding deterrence but if need be I will pull more evidence in. Point 2: It is actually more expensive than locking someone up. For example, in California ""The additional cost of confining an inmate to death row, as compared to the maximum security prisons w here those sentenced to life without possibility of parole ordinarily serve their sentences, is $90,000 per year per inmate.""[2] The costs of the death penalty system are about $137 million per year whereas a new reform where a maximum life sentence would be issued would cost $11.5 million per year.[2] This is a huge difference and shows the massive costs associated with the death penalty. Point 3: It is entirely possible that one could kill the wrong guy. If this is the case there is nothing you can do. He is dead and cannot be brought back. All that the state can do is say ""Whoops, my bad"" and give money to the grieving family whereas if the person is in jail and they then see he is innocent, he is still alive and can live the rest of his life.

death penalty,"I do not necessarily disagree with my opponents points. There is a problem of discrimination. There is a problem of cost. There is a problem of wrongful convictions. But I disagree that these are problems inherent in the death penalty. In other words I do not believe that these problems are the fault of the death penalty itself. Let me start with his first point that the death penalty is expensive. Because the death penalty can sometimes take 20 years to complete the process, the cost is great. As a matter of fact, at one point executions in California were costing 30 million dollars. But this is not the fault of the death penalty. The actual execution is very cheap. But the reason the death penalty is so expensive is because of the judicial system. If we reformed the death penalty, then we could make it where there is one trial, and in that trial the jury decides whether to sentence the person to death or not. If this happened the death penalty would be so much more cheaper than life imprisonment that we would actually be saving money by using the death penalty. My opponents second point is that there is a racial discrimination. This isn't the fault of the death penalty, this is a problem with us as a country. If we don't discriminate against blacks and other races, then this problem won't be occurring. Even if we abolished the death penalty, racial discrimination will still be happening. It's not like abolishing the death penalty will cause racial discrimination to go away. The problem is us as a nation, not the death penalty. My opponents third point is that wrongful convictions occur. This is true, and no matter how we will reform the death penalty, this problem will still be occurring. But the same problem will be happening if we abolish the death penalty. Let's say that we sent all killers to life in prison. In the year 1998 6,500 prisoners escaped and murdered again. This is huge compared to the small amount of wrongful convictions. If we abolished the death penalty, the amount of innocent people killed will only go up.

death penalty,"I am disappointed that nargiz_gab has forfeited this round. However, I would like to present my argument for why the death penalty ought not be supported and to do so I would like to explore the reasons that the UN’s General Assembly gave in support for its 2008 moratorium on the death penalty (UN resolution 62/149). I quote: ""Considering that the use of the death penalty undermines human dignity, and convinced that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement and progressive development of human rights, that there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent value of the death penalty and that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the death penalty is irreversible and irreparable."" [1] The reasons the UN gives in support against the death penalty are thus: a) That the death penalty undermines human dignity. b) That not using the death penalty would strengthen human rights. c) That the deterrent value of the death penalty is inconclusive. d) That any miscarriage or failure of justice using the death penalty is irreversible and irreparable. The thrust of my argument will rest on d), that any miscarriage or failure of justice using the death penalty is irreversible and irreparable. We, as humans, are liable to err (we’re not omniscient) and therefore miscarriages of justice will occur. We are, in a word, fallible. Now, if the death penalty was not instituted and an alternative, say, life imprisonment was instituted instead, then we allow ourselves an opportunity to rectify any miscarriages of justice that do occur. What good is it to the innocent person, who was wrongly executed, to know that a court, upon further examination of existing or even new evidence, found that person posthumously not guilty? It is, therefore, irreparable since the, later found, innocent person is already dead. Consequently, however expedient the death penalty may be, we ought not, on the principle that humans are liable to err, support the death penalty since miscarriages of justice will occur and that any miscarriage of justice using the death penalty, by definition, is irreversible and irreparable.

death penalty,"You never said it was not a punishment but you did say that it's point was to keep the person from committing the crime again. I'm saying, again, that it's point is to punish. And the punishment is cruel. The mentally ill are to be evaluated during the process of the trials and appeals, before the final sentencing. Just because a person has to get evaluated doesn't mean that they themselves feel that they have a problem. It means someone else does. So maybe you didn't understand what I said. You started off saying that a person should seek help before it leads to them committing a crime. I replied that not everyone who is mentally ill DOES NOT KNOW that they have a problem, therefore they wouldn't be inclined to seek help. So no, it's not a fact that they (the criminal) know. As for Norway, I'm comparing the systems. The US has one CJS. If I'm critiquing a flaw in the system should I not compare it to another system? What other system should I compare it to? Again, my point is that there is a different way to handle the criminals we are speaking about. I happened to use Norway as an example because they have a different system that does not use the death penalty and that works in reducing the recidivism rate, and recidivism is a point that you brought up. Crime IS committed in the US either way, but whether the death penalty being in place helps in deterring or allowing crime was neither of our arguments. So you brought that to my attention to help you make what point? Criminal Justice Systems, no matter where they are, are all created for the same reason. The ACTUAL EXECUTION cost may be $86 but do you simply bring charges up on them sit them in a chair and give them a shot? No. You have to go through the whole process before you can even administer the injection. ""The greatest costs associated with the death penalty occur prior to and during trial, not in post-conviction proceedings. Even if all post-conviction proceedings (appeals) were abolished, the death penalty would still be more expensive than alternative sentences."" (http://www.amnestyusa.org...). The death penalty is still more expensive than LWOP. For example, in California the death penalty costs 90,000 per inmate per year. As of 2011, the amount of inmates on death row are 670, that's $63.3 million a year. compared to $44,463. (http://www.forbes.com...) Your whole health care argument is a completely different topic.

death penalty,"Thank you. Here's my argument: 1. Retribution(Source: http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org...) Although the victim and the victim's family cannot be restored to the status which preceded the murder, at least an execution brings closure to the murderer's crime (and closure to the ordeal for the victim's family) and ensures that the murderer will create no more victims. For the most cruel and heinous crimes, the ones for which the death penalty is applied, offenders deserve the worst punishment under our system of law, and that is the death penalty. Any lesser punishment would undermine the value society places on protecting lives. Robert Macy, District Attorney of Oklahoma City, described his concept of the need for retribution in one case: ""In 1991, a young mother was rendered helpless and made to watch as her baby was executed. The mother was then mutilated and killed. The killer should not lie in some prison with three meals a day, clean sheets, cable TV, family visits and endless appeals. For justice to prevail, some killers just need to die."" 2. Deterrence(Source: http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org...) Society has always used punishment to discourage would-be criminals from unlawful action. Since society has the highest interest in preventing murder, it should use the strongest punishment available to deter murder, and that is the death penalty. If murderers are sentenced to death and executed, potential murderers will think twice before killing for fear of losing their own life. For years, criminologists analyzed murder rates to see if they fluctuated with the likelihood of convicted murderers being executed, but the results were inconclusive. Then in 1973 Isaac Ehrlich employed a new kind of analysis which produced results showing that for every inmate who was executed, 7 lives were spared because others were deterred from committing murder. Similar results have been produced by disciples of Ehrlich in follow-up studies. Moreover, even if some studies regarding deterrence are inconclusive, that is only because the death penalty is rarely used and takes years before an execution is actually carried out. Punishments which are swift and sure are the best deterrent. The fact that some states or countries which do not use the death penalty have lower murder rates than jurisdictions which do is not evidence of the failure of deterrence. States with high murder rates would have even higher rates if they did not use the death penalty. I have a couple of points that I will present in the next rounds.",PRO,"Retribution(Source: http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org...)

death penalty,"I have several big problems with the death penalty. A) What if the person turns out to be innocent? Now, this may seem like an unlikley scenario, however, that is not the case. According to Scientific American, researchers estimate that more than 340 U.S. inmates that could have been exonerated were sentenced to death since 1973. [1] That is 340 people wrongfully excecuted by the government, not to mention all of the executions before 1973. B) The death penalty cost taxpayers an enormous ammount of money. For example- Defending a death penalty case costs about four times as much as defending a case where the death penalty is not sought, according to a new study by the Kansas Judicial Council. A new study of the cost of the death penalty in Colorado revealed that capital proceedings require six times more days in court and take much longer to resolve than life-without-parole (LWOP) cases. The cost of the death penalty in California has totaled over $4 billion since 1978. New York State spent $170 million in 9 years, with no executions. [1] And these are just a few states. Rebuttal 1. Possibility of escape. Criminals can, and have, escaped from prison. The source below is just one example of this. Escaping prison doesn't happen often enough for it to pose a suitable risk. Also, according to this ABC news article, prison escapes are on the decline. [2] 2. Danger to other prisoners. A criminal such as a sociopathic criminal can, and does, present a danger to other prisoners. Sociopathic prisoners could be placed in solitary confinement. Solitary was made just for cases such as this. In the USA alone, over 2.3 million people are currently incarcerated. Not only does housing a dangerous prisoner cause potential harm for other prisoners and guards, but it also increases the already enormous prison population. Killing people because of overpopulation is wrong for obvious reasons. Also, only thirty-nine prisoners were executed last year. This obviously does not pose a significant risk to prison overpopulation. Knowing that the person who murdered a loved one is dead provides closure to some families. It makes people feel good to know that someone who killed innocent people got what they deserved. The perpetrator of the crime being dead may not completely remove the sadness of losing a loved one, but it can help the process of grieving. Personally, I would rather have that person rot in jail for the rest of their life than be killed.

death penalty,"This debate is to say what your opinion is about the death penalty. In my opinion the death penalty is closure for the people who have gone through these horrific event. Although one of this will make the harmed person alive and/or forget what happened, but I think the death penalty helps the people get their an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth feeling. A death sentence brings finality to a horrible chapter in the lives of these family members. It is a form of crime deterrent. Some people say that this is false because statistics prove otherwise, here's how it still does. There are 18,000 people on death row on average. Only a few ever get the dealing. If most of those people got the punishment then I could guarantee that crime would lower. And most of the people aren't appealed out of the process, they are sitting in jail for 15 years and then getting killed by a fellow inmate. So most of them aren't innocents getting let out. Justice is better served. The most fundamental principle of justice is that the punishment should fit the crime. When someone plans and brutally murders another person, doesn't it make sense that the punishment for the perpetrator also be death? Our justice system shows more sympathy for criminals than it does victims. It's time we put the emphasis of our criminal justice system back on protecting the victim rather than the accused. Remember, a person who's on death row has almost always committed crimes before this. A long line of victims have been waiting for justice. We need justice for current and past victims. There is no alternative. Even if you are in a life sentence without parole you can still be let out. Here's a good example of a crazed baby killer let out of jail at this link: http://www.prodeathpenalty.com... there are multiple people in this listing.

death penalty,"Debate we shall! First of all forgive any blunders for this is my first debate and i just joined the site. Okay, the death penalty, in my opinion is completely fair and its hard for me to understand how someone can believe its not. You will more than likely talk about how some people who would have been sentenced to death ended up changing their lives around and even writing children's books, but does it replace the lives that that person took or is it enough to compensate for whatever crime they committed? The death penalty is more than fair for multiple reasons. For one, lets say someone murders someone else, or even kills multiple people, why shouldn't the killer die also? Death penalty now-a-days is completely painless, the person doesn't feel anything. The people he murdered probably didn't have the luxury of a painless death. On another issue, death penalties take time, the court session and all can go on for years and once someone is sentenced to death they have the luxury of having plenty of time to say their goodbyes. Someone receiving the death penalty is able to straighten their finances, say goodbye to family or friends, and even get saved by a priest in which they would go to heaven (if you're a Christian). The people that died at the hands of the killer did not have that pleasure, they did not have the opportunity to straighten their lives. So if a man can kill another and not die themselves, wheres the justice in that? How is that fair to the family of the ones who are dead?

death penalty,"Rebuttals Deterrence There's no evidence that the death penalty does, indeed, deter people. However, same goes with the opposite. However, it is more preferrable to assume that it does indeed, deter people because the power of suggestion influences people's decisions[1], and you would think that people are deterred since they don't want to be penalized by death. A Moral argument I believe that if someone murders (act of unlawfully killing someone[2]), that act warrants the death penalty, meaning that they deserve to be penalized by death, so both sides (The victim and the criminal) come out evenly and equally. That can be called retribution. Getting the wrong guy I don't think this would happen anymore. Why? There is a 25 year imprisonment beforehand. And during that period, you will be DNA tested to realize if that person was rightfully convicted or not. Price Although the price is relatively expensive, that's really on those who imposed it, not us.

death penalty,"Death, of course, is something you can count on. But authorities do not have the right to bring an end to someone's life, whether they are a criminal or not. Killing someone does not guarantee that crime rates in America would decrease. We as a nation have moved past this whole ""eye for an eye"" punishment, because it didn't work in the past and it most likely won't work today. First off, many people who commit these crimes have serious psychological problems. How are you going to kill someone for being mentally disturbed? What they need is help, not an execution. Second, people sometimes have situations where they committed a crime in an act of defense. Such a case can be stated if a son killed his father in defense that the father was abusing him, or trying to kill him. Sending the son for the death penalty would be wrong in this case. If America were to adopt the death penalty nationally, we would have to implement a series of cases that would be acceptable for using the death penalty, and even then, how do we define those morals? It's complicated. Also, I wouldn't doubt our prisons. If anything, we can establish more prisons and prison guards to help protect the grounds from criminals escaping.

Also, when someone is sentenced to jail for murder, there is absolutely no chance of bail or parole. That rule is set in place so that the murderer can't get out, then kill again.

death penalty,"Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA [Justice for All] estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million-$3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP. The fact that blacks and Hispanics are charged with capital crimes out of proportion to their numbers in the general population may simply mean that blacks and Hispanics commit capital crimes out of proportion to their numbers. Capital criminals don't look like America. No one is surprised to find more men than women in this class. Nor is it a shock to find that this group contains more twenty-year-olds than septuagenarians. And if — as the left tirelessly maintains — poverty breeds crime, and if — as it tiresomely maintains — the poor are disproportionately minority, then it must follow — as the left entirely denies — that minorities will be 'overrepresented' among criminals.

death penalty,"in 1971 the LosAngeles Police Department reported that half of a group of suspects under arrest for robbery stated that they had decided not to carry or not use weapons in their ""work"" to avoid any risk of a killing which could lead to their own execution. In 1973 Isaac Ehrlich employed a new kind of analysis which produced results showing that for every inmate who was executed, 7 lives were spared because others were deterred from committing murder. Moreover, Even if some studies regarding deterrence are inconclusive, That is only because the death penalty is rarely used and takes years before an execution is actually carried out. Punishments which are swift and sure are the best deterrent. The fact that some states or countries which do not use the death penalty have lower murder rates than jurisdictions which do is not evidence of the failure of deterrence. States with high murder rates would have even higher rates if they did not use the death penalty. Finally, The death penalty certainly ""deters"" the murderer who is executed. Strictly speaking, This is a form of incapacitation, Similar to the way a robber put in prison is prevented from robbing on the streets. Vicious murderers must be killed to prevent them from murdering again, Either in prison, Or in society if they should get out. Both as a deterrent and as a form of permanent incapacitation, The death penalty helps to prevent future crime. Since society has the highest interest in preventing murder. It should be the strongest punishment for deterring. For Religion I simply said that you can ignore the argument, But no you had to laugh.

How hipocritic is it of us to say that killing people is wring and never to be done, only to kill that person in return.

Currently we are the only Western nation to still allow the death penalty. 97 countries worldwide have outlawed the death penalty for all crimes. 9 countries only permit the death penalty in cases of treason or terrorism. 35 countries have temporarily banned the death penalty and are currently attempting to ban it.

In fact, the study starts with 65 years old and as it goes down, the disapproval rating goes up showing that future generations are more aware of the brutality of capital punishment and even more hope for even higher disapproval ratings in the future.

I was a lawyer. I have seen much injustice in the courts. Routine injustice. Lying cops, lying prosecutors, lying judges. Ignorance of the law you wouldn't believe. I once had a judge reject a speedy trial argument on this ground: ""We don't do Constitutional law in this court."" I saw a county judge tell the state court of appeals that they didn't have jurisdiction over him. I saw a judge say that he has ""general policy"" of refusing to set bond. A friend saw a judge tell a defendant, ""Now, don't you go crawling off to some higher court!"" Ask any lawyer you know: he'll tell you that he knows judges who, for lack of sense or judicial attitude, should not be judges. Every trial is a coin flip. The only way I expect justice from the court system is on average. That is, a guilty person may be acquitted this time, but he'll probably be arrested again, and he may be convicted that time; an innocent person may be convicted this time, but, if he's really a law-abiding type, he may not ever get prosecuted again. The court system is so unreliable that it shouldn't have the big gun. One study used DNA evidence to test the guilt of executed people. In _most_ of the cases it tested, the executed person was innocent. Irretrievably dead, but innocent. That's our court system at work, when it has the death penalty.

Now people think we should bring it back. Iowa should continue to not have the death penalty and use the alternative, life in prison. This is because it has some major flaws. First and foremost death penalty states have higher murder rates. In 2013 the average death penalty state murder rate was a 4.4. While non-death penalty states murder rates where a 3.4. (DIPC 1). Since Iowa has a murder rate of only 1.4 there is no reason to switch. Also death penalty states make up 75% of the top 25 highest murder rates in the country. Thus proving the death penalty does not lower murder rates. Murder rates are not the only thing the death penalty rises, court cases are also affected. Court cases that seek the death penalty cost more than those who do not. A Death Penalty Advisory Committee study shows that death penalty seeking cases cost on average $395,792 to the defense. While only $98,963 for non-death penalty seeking cases. Their fore death penalty seeking cases cost 4 times more than non-death penalty seeking cases. Definitely not worth the money. Overpriced court cases are not the only problem in the courtroom innocent lives are also at stake. The number of innocent lives put on death row is too high to be worth it. Since reinstatement in 1973 ""at least 121 people have been released from death row"". At the same time ""over 982 people have been executed"" Thus an 8 to 1 innocence rate.

Some improvements are small, like the new paste options we introduced in Office 2010. Other features reduce the amount of time it takes to accomplish a task like Flash Fill and Quick Analysis in Excel. The breadth of capabilities Office can lead to significant gains in what people can accomplish. With Google Docs, on the other hand, people have to find ways to overcome feature gaps by working harder, spending their time finding workarounds, or potentially using third-party tools to overcome the gaps.""

Google is making changes that most of the users of Youtube have been and are expressing their distaste in. Google has mostly been ignoring every bit of criticizm and stubbornly refuses to change what they have done even when pressed about it. 2.)

Large channels like MinnesotaBurns and Pewdiepie have started turning comments off in their videos along with Nerd Cubed, because of the problems they cause. 3.)

Even then of the countless number of ways that we have tried to guarantee safety through history--we have never been able to. ""Crime"" does exist within the populace and it is the only 100% certainty I see.

What does it explain us? A recent discovery shows us that a Google analytics (a tool used to analyse the traffic for your site) has the ability to read clicks coming from the Google home application of your mobile device and treating it as the direct traffic. Whenever you asked something or search something useful from the Google home device, it will throw you or respond you back with the related answer, and for doing this thing, it has to be involved in data to find the particular resource. Those type results usually come from information stored on the Google’s indexed web pages. When direct traffic is outsourced The entire relevant search performed by the user or recent visiting history of the user can bring the user to the original resource of this information. Google somehow considering this traffic organic because Google tends to discover the originality of this content as Google home app. However, a deep research shows that a Google is counting this as the direct traffic. Usually, a direct traffic is counted whenever someone either manually enters the URL into the address bar in their browser or when someone enters the unique query in URL. Google can adjust this thing in near future, but for now, we can say that the Google is treating this traffic of Google home app as the direct one. Giving explanation for the direct traffic to clients Whenever you see a direct traffic is rising on the websites, then you will come to know that there are many people out there in the world who may are typing the URL of your site to directly navigate to your home page. There can be many scenarios that could be resulted into the direct traffic for example emails, links from https websites, etc. Problems may occur only in case of miss-categorized results like untagged links from emails that can give a tight sign to your clients that you need to have proper tag links in order to track traffic correctly. Conclusion With the mobile friendly indexing of the web by Google now almost 60 to 70 percent of the searches are coming from the mobile devices so for this to be successful and free from any errors a perfect mobile-friendly approach to counting the direct traffic in the must.

Google is a for-profit, publicly-held company at the end of the day.

First of all there are only one or two apple phones that come out every year while hundreds of Android phone come out. Second you said that the HTC One M8 is number one, well the HTC One M8 just came out. When the new iPhone comes out give me a call. Next Retina Display is NOT just a "" marketing term invented and overused by Apple"". Retina Display is a high resolution display used and loved by many. I agree that most people don't need a retina display, but if you are using it to edit photos, watch videos, and read book, this is where it is needed the most. The display is not comparable to androids displays because of the differences in the technology. Lastly Android devices with similar displays are not too far off of the price of apple products. You said that apples devices aren't as Premium because of the delicate screen. This is not because of the device it self it is mainly because of the consumer. When someone gets a apple device they want to show it off so they won't put cases on it. This will then cause the device to be more fragile. To prove this I have an iPod with the Griffin Survivor case and got bored so I dropped it off a two story building and it survived without a crack, scratch, or dent. Since my opening statement has now been justified lets continue. I will just start with this it is easy to jailbreak an iOS device and that will give all the functionality of a android. Also browsers can be downloaded very easily. You talked about fake apps and malware, I am sorry these such things don't exist on Apple but they do exist on Android. Go Apple!! Paid and free app have nothing to do with the phone. With apple you can jailbreak, while with android you can just illegally download and put them on. That Concludes my Explanation and Pointing out the Flaws in your Argument. Next in my argument there is many things wrong with Android. 1. Stability- android devices crash ALOT! this causes alot of inconvenience. 2. Speed- Apple is optimized for speed, Android is NOT. Android needs to stuff more RAM, faster Processors, and better Graphics. While the iPhone uses an A6 1.3 GHz, the HTC one M8 uses a Krait 400 2.3 GHz, while both are around the same speed. 3. Lack of uniformity- All of the Androids are different which leads to many problems and issues. The skins on the android basically make the consumer have to relearn the operating system all over again.

google,"Google’s business is inseparable from basic human rights The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), a UN conference, affirmed that access to information is a basic human right, a corollary to the freedom of opinion and expression as articulated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[1] It is a right because access to information is often basic to human life; to how to live in society, to work and to educate ourselves. China ratified the Universal Declaration back in 1948 when it was accepted by the UN’s General Assembly, and was a party to the WSIS 2003 conference. This means that, if China is to be a responsible member of the international community, we can expect them to uphold the principles they publicly declare. Google’s mission is ‘to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful’. Note that this mission happens to coincide with the basic human right of access to information. This is why Google’s choice to interfere with China’s domestic politics isn’t just ‘big business interfering with a state’s sovereign politics’ – it’s a case of a big business whose business model happens to be providing a basic human right the sovereign state should have, by its own accord, provided a long time ago.

google,"Monopoly is natural and inevitable for data giants. If your 'product' is simply the flow of information, the only feasible business model is to be pretty much the only player in a given market. Humans must recognize that data giants are creatures fundamentally different from, and superior to, brick and mortar corporations of the previous century, and even sovereign states. New rules must be established for them.

Data is the new oil: whoever controls the flow of information can or will eventually control everything. The problem is not that Twitter deplatformed Trump. A democratic process to establish rules for when someone can be 'censored' would have likely ended in the same result. The problem is that those rules were not made democratically and are not enforced in a transparent and accountable process. Instead the rules are made and enforced by a few data oligarchs with zero accountability to the people who create all the value they feed off, and who are most prominently affected by their decisions. 

More and more 'real' jobs will become obsolete and be performed instead by AI, which will probably be owned by tech giants. This directly removes economic power from humans, and concentrates it in the hands of the few major shareholders and directors of these companies (Amazon's destruction of the entire retail value chain in the US is a good example). This immense value should instead flow to the human participants of these systems, as some form of data dividend or UBI, to offset the loss of income caused by automation. 

No given nation state can or should constrain tech giants. The machinery of traditional democracy is too slow and inefficient. Additionally, the impacts that these companies have are transnational by their very nature. The democracy that should control them has not yet been born but, I believe, will be based online, rather than geographically determined jurisdictions.

I don't believe that the options available in terms of antitrust regulation can effectively deal with data monopolies. Antitrust law is based on a number of presumptions that simply don't apply to giant tech (such as the presumption that monopoly will always lead to a failure in quality and a rise in prices). Breaking them up will take us a few steps back in terms of information flow, but will not change the fact that monopoly is completely logical and even necessary for a data-driven platform to function properly. Whatsapp only works because pretty much everyone uses it. It should be owned by everyone.

vegan,"Thank you for the great debate topic. Pro's definition of veganism is that of the ethical vegan, which is the orthodox side of veganism. Other types of veganism exist such as dietary veganism, where the reasons for becoming a vegan are more for personal health benefits rather than for the salvation of animals. http://en.wikipedia.org... I would class the dietary vegans in somewhat of a conservative or reformed type of veganism. Some ethical (orthodox) vegans do not like dietary vegans to be called real vegans because they aren't fully converted to the full vegan lifestyle. http://www.theveganwoman.com... You'll see me draw several parallels between veganism and religion in my arguments as I will show that vegansim is very much a type of religion. It's not a religion that touches the subject of God, but its a religion where the orthodox adherents must not waver in their vegan beliefs or actions unless they are to be ridiculed and excommunicated from the community of orthodox vegans. I hold that every person should have the freedom to do what they choose, live the life they want to live, and live with the positive or negative consequences of their decisions.

Terms: Well planned diet: A diet which can be designed by a layperson with a reasonable amount of research Vegan (or plant-based) diet: A diet that excludes animal body parts, animal milk and eggs Healthier: Greater longevity and freedom from disease Meat-based (or animal-based) diet: A diet which regularly consists of animal products (body parts, animal milk and eggs) In this debate, I will argue that plant-based diets are healthier than meat-based diets. I will highlight the virtues of vegan diets and the vices of meat-based diets. My opponent will do the opposite; pointing out the flaws of a vegan diet and arguing in favor of a meat based one. This debate will be based on dietetic evidence obtained from modern, reputable scientific studies. Discussing what evolution ""designed"" us for or what our physiology ""proves"" we should eat can be interesting. However, I would encourage my opponent to base his or her arguments on modern dietetic science as I think this is more relevant to the resolution. During the debate I will point out the role animal-based foods play in cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes. I will respond to criticisms of well planned vegan diets as my opponent provides them. In this round I will begin with cardiovascular disease: World-wide, cardiovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease end more lives prematurely than anything else[1][2]. In North America, CVD accounts for 40% of all deaths[3]. The American Heart Association estimates that ""79,400,000 American adults (one in three) have one or more types of cardiovascular disease""[4]. Dietary cholesterol is only found in animal foods[5] and is not necessary for humans to consume as it is naturally produced by the liver[6][7]. Scientist estimate that for every 1% increase in cholesterol levels, the risk of heart disease raises by 2-3%[3]. Saturated fats, transfatty acids and dietary cholesterol are the most significant causes of hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels)[3]. Of all dietary groups, vegans have the lowest levels of these substances in their blood[3]. Furthermore, the substances that mitigate hypercholesterolemia are soluble fiber, plant protein (especially soy protein), polyunsaturated fats and phytochemicals[3]. These substances are only found in plant foods and are, as a consequence, more abundant in vegans[3]. In summary, vegans have the lowest risk of developing cardiovascular disease; the leading cause of deaths. 1 http://en.wikipedia.org... 2 http://www.who.int... 3 http://books.google.com...

The Cummunist Manifesto “Let the guzzling classes tremble at a Cummunist revolution. The harlotarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!” –Karl “Big Gulp” Marx The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain’t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes.

We chop down trees, we dirty up water, we burn oil and coal, we dig and landscape every other acre of earth, we capture animals and genetically change them to be our fluffy pets instead of letting them roam free in the environment, we run over squirrels, and instead of eating food that grows from our surroundings, we destroy land that is already there, plant new plants that aren't natural to the area, and then they take the crops and turn them in to something more desired. Simply put, humans are selfish. We all do things that destroy the environment for our personal gain with little regards for the environment. So, we as humans are selfish and care less about others for our own personal reasons. If this debate is how vegans are better and smarter than meat eaters, than this debate is not a good idea. You and I (I'm assuming you're a vegan) are only different because of our eating choices. We are both, at the end of the day are selfish, less caring beings because we are humans.

vegan,"Thank you for your response. The argument I made about me being more selfish was meant to be taken on a very, very broad scale. If I do support the murder of fellow earthlings than yeah, I am selfish. BUT, and I'm not saying it's okay, but why do we draw the line at animals' living condition (current state of life)? Why don't we draw the line at destroying their habitats, using them for testing and using them for experiments? And if the line is drawn there as well, why is the only frontline of this battle? Why is vegan the start of it all? Animals who are not meant to eat meat would probably reject it when ingested, however, humans, whom are animals, do not reject it (actually, on some scale, I do. I have IBS but... another story another time). I know this area of this popular debate was not mentioned, I just wanted to throw that out there.

At this point, having had captured and farmed so many animals for so long, many farm animals have genetically changed over time to depend largly on humans, making life hard for them if they were free. We as humans let them live a pretty good life before meeting it's end. My point is, it would take a lot of years to reverse what we have done, and it would also destroy the first world (and some lesser) economies.

Pro has also opted to argue for the morality of veganism, but unless Pro also intends on arguing for objective morality, the ""morality"" of veganism becomes relative to the form of morality being discussed, which defeats the purpose of arguing for the morality of anything.

vegan,"I concede that a super well-educated, highly intelligent nutritionist could make veganism a healthier way of life than other diet choices. However we must face the sad fact that this group of people is a tiny majority. Most people struggle with the idea of where their food comes from, let alone protein, vitamin and mineral content. So for the average person, being vegan poses a serious risk. Whereas when you eat a wide range of foods (as is inevitable if you have no dietary preferences), it's actually quite difficult to avoid a nutrient entirely, if you are a vegan, it is simply much easier. If you exclude fish from your diet, you exclude omega 3s and 6s, when you exclude meat, you exclude primary sources of protein, when you exclude milk, you exclude a crucial source of calcium... So the list goes on. If you make sufficient compensation for these issues, it is not a problem. However the majority of people don't appreciate the wide range of nutrients you end up omitting from your diet when you become vegan. Even for those who do, sometimes alternative foods have to be taken in such enormous quantities that its just impractical. Daily buckets of chickpeas simply aren't always the most efficient to ingest sufficient protein. So while, in theory, being vegan avoids health problems like cardiovascular disease (often caused by too much animal fats) it is not a healthier way of life. Suggesting that it is a healthier way of life entirely fails to address the fact that cardiovascular disease and problems with over consumption are often replaced with the equally dangerous problems that come with under consumption. Nutrient deficiency, protein deficiency and even starvation are just a few of the problems that omitting so many food groups can inadvertently cause. Another flaw in your argument is the fact that you seem to think becoming vegan will magically make your entire lifestyle healthier, not just your diet. This is quite simply not true. Taking all animal products out of your diet will not do one iota to change how much time you spend on the couch, how many times you go running a week or whether you walk or take the car. A healthy lifestyle is so much more than diet and therefore it is impossible to say that changing one aspect of your diet will have a magical knock on effect on the rest of your life choices.",CON,"So while, in theory, being vegan avoids health problems like cardiovascular disease (often caused by too much animal fats) it is not a healthier way of life. ...

He also said that excluding fish form your diet will make you deficient in omegas 3 and omegas 6 which also not true there are many plants that have those same nutrients that have about the same amount of grams ratio of fish. These foods include avocados and green leafy vegetables which if you are vegan you will be eating a lot of green leafy vegetables, and if you don""t corn, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and nuts too.

Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's ""semenal work"". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is ""seminal"", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious. Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then ""finish the job"" by swallowing his muck will ""remove antagonism"" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity.

vegan,"Pro claims sperm is a commodity because of the value a lady (or man or transgender or animorph) places on it. But a thing having value does not make it a commodity. I appreciate the sun, moon, stairs, and rain [1] but these things are not commodities – commodities are things which can be bought and sold and owned. Pro has a point that fertility clinics buy sperm- If a vegan went to a clinic, bought a vial of sperm, and threw it back like a vodka shot it may be hypocritical. Yet even in this case the man freely gave this sample- unlike the forceful coercion of animals. But the resolution is about swallowing after oral sex, not clinics- a situation where no commercial transaction occurs. Pro avoids engaging in seminal sementics, sementing my victory by ignoring the intellectual girth and thrust of Marx. Pro rightfully points out that swallowing semen is beneficial to women’s health due to its high protein content, it also reduces risk of breast cancer [2]. But vegans object to the ethical content of eating animal products, not the protein content. Pro misses the jizt of my argument. An analogy: suppose I say “I am ethically opposed to slapping babies and so will not slap babies.” Then one day I see a baby choking on… semolina pasta. I slap the baby on the back, dislodging the food. No one would accuse me of being a hypocrite because I did not violate the ethical spirit of my pledge. In the same way, cum guzzling does not violate the ethical spirit of veganism. Finally, extend my argument that semen drinking solves class disparity- as Pro concedes.

vegan,"I will accept your argument on the CON side meaning my stance is meat is as good if not better for your health, for the earth, and for humanity then the vegan diet. Meat contains high amounts of protein. Protein is essential for the function of muscles and bones. The consumption of animal protein is associated with increased muscle mass, meaning people who eat a meat diet tend to have more muscle then a vegan diet. Studies show that consumption of protein is beneficial to increased bone density meaning with old age as your bones get weaker animal protein will help conserve bone mass. Meat is also nutritious; 3.5 ounces of raw ground beef contains large amounts of B12, Creatine, Carnosine, and DHA and EPA; these nutrients can not be found in vegetables. B12 is important because it cannot be found in plants, studies looked at vegans who don’t get B12 in their normal diet and 92% of them were deficient. Creatine reserves energy for the brain and for muscle movement, people who are deficient have reduced physical and mental performance. Carnosine is a powerful anti-oxidant which provides protection against many degenerative processes. DHA and EPA refer to Omega-3. It is easier than having to have specific plant based diet to just eat meat to acquire your nutrients. Meat eating is good for the environment because the raising of cattle if grass fed is good for the health of the soil and the grass. The eating of the grass stimulates vegetative growth. Also the trampling of hoofs and digestive tracts promote seed germination and nutrient recycling. There have been claims that the farts of the cattle is one of the leading causes to Green house gases. According to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2010; all of the U.S. agriculture accounts for 8% of green house emissions. The majority of the emissions are from crop farming because of the crop and soil management. Union concerned scientists reported that only about 2% of the green house gasses are connected to cattle farming. (http://www.wsj.com...) Finally meat is good for humanity. If you look at our history we are omnivores we eat meat and plants. It is in biological adaption to be able to eat meat and plants while taking in the nutrients. Humans have much shorter digestive systems than herbivores meaning we don’t have adapted organs to digest cellulose. This means we are not able digest the main fiber in plants. Humans also have canine teeth, thumbs, and a brain, which shows that we are evolutionarily supposed to eat meat because all three of those factors make us hunters.

We cannot afford to let this natural oxygen producing and pollutant sponge to be destroyed. The feed lot method puts a massive strain on our water supplies. According to the FoK documentary the world's cattle alone could fed 9 billion people. [2] That's assuming we fed the grain used for cattle directly to humans. Combine that with a whooping 2,500 gallons per pound of beef, and you got an environmental disaster.

Other meats while more efficient than beef, are still considerably less efficient than plant based alternatives. [4] With chicken requiring 2.5x and pork 4x. Yet, this is both the inedible and edible parts. Take out the inedible and even milk requires 10% more pounds of grain than produced. Chicken 4.5, pork 7.3, and cattle 20 ibs of feed per ib of edible meat. Fishing is not any better. [5][6] Not only are we simply running out of fish, but we are destroying the ocean habitat. This includes the beautiful coral reefs. Factory farming fish has its own perils. [7] Catfish require 2 ibs of grain per ib of fish.

I don't quite understand your logic here. For the sake of the argument I am going to assume you mean: You can love and appreciate animals, whilst acknowledging that human nature can cause them suffering. This is true, but it doesn't really mean that choosing to not support the meat market isn't a more compassionate or ethical choice. To assume and accept human nature as cruel, and to be a pacifist on that logic, is a clear example of somebody being more ignorant, more selfish or less caring than someone, who also knows human nature has been cruel, and yet chooses to resist it. I don't think anyone can argue with that. Slavery and the womens rights movement give us examples of the two groups of the population-one which want to maintain the status-quo, and the other that saw that it is was wrong and wanted to improve the lives of the underdogs. People are quick to judge Nazis, women oppressors and slave owners, yet the majority of these people are just like the meat eating portion of the population-they are either to ignorant to care for ethics, too easily led into supporting anything they are told too, or they are just plain self-grandiose and self-interested.

vegan,"So you are basically saying that eating meat is not unethical. And therefore my claim that eating meat is less ethical than being a vegetarian, is false. However, I am skeptical about your reasoning. Your method of judging ethics is new to me. You mention a part of the brain that triggers when we do something unethical, this is not exactly accurate. I mean the leading scientists say the brain is still not truly understood. Could you elaborate this point further and name the part of the brain that does this please so I know where to begin in debunking it. 'Ethics' is just the vocalization sound I have used to help describe the phenomena of the consideration for others. If you want to talk about brains and physiology then consider this: What we understand as 'love' or 'compassion' is an evolutionary tool to keep us in social groups and 'persuade' us to raise our young. (solitary animals don't feel it-for they have not needed to maintain the group in order to survive). 'Love' is actually a 'thing', its a hormone, it can be measured. It has been 'created' by evolution. There is no 'ethics' part of the brain, there is a hormone that is produced that encourages us to love, and that is it. We therefore have love, but it only extends to our family and our tribe, as its evolutionary function is to maintain group loyalty and family groups. As humans become less ignorant and more aware and connected, there 'love' expands to meet a wider group of beings as we learn to understand them. So we learn that the other tribe are actually quite similar and we encorperate them as well. People are still hateful of other nationalities, other races, people they don't understand or see as themselves, but 'good' people recognise that we are all equal, no matter how different we are. So my argument is that to incorporate other species into our circle of love is a step forward in ethics. How can cruelty to other earthlings be more ethical than not being cruel? I don't agree with your view on how we should determine ethics. Also, even with your view on ethics I still think I am right. For instance, killing an animal makes us feel horrible (until we desensitise), and if feeling horrible and cruel isn't a reflection of 'bad ethics' in my brain, then what is ?",PRO,"If you want to talk about brains and physiology then consider this: What we understand as 'love' or 'compassion' is an evolutionary tool to keep us in social groups and 'persuade' us to raise our young. ...

It costs far more resources to produce meat than other food, so it would therefore mean less strain on the worlds resources over all. 2. To keep up with the demand for meat, the industry must force grow its product. This always results in less than decent standards of welfare for the animals. 3.

Finally, even if you believe that consumption of animals is wrong, cows, pigs, and other animals we eat are domesticated and rely greatly on us to survive. If we stopped using them for food, we would not have a really good reason to continue keeping them in our care and feeding them with our resources.

Our development as humans has included meat as a necessary component dating back millions of years. In nature, and without access to meat, we wouldn't have developed as we know ourselves today. There simply weren't enough calories available otherwise to select for the large, calorie-hungry brains we have. Our relatively small teeth and jaws didn't come about until after we had developed processing techniques for our food. Those processing techniques required large brains to develop, and those brains required high-calorie diets that were only attainable through meat eating at the time.

Either way, I'll need some more information to be able to discuss this point. 3) We need to eat raw vegetables and limited processed foods. I would say this depends on your personal preference and certainly isn't a need in the strictest sense. Our survival doesn't depend on this. You'll be perfectly fine eating cooked vegetables. As far as processed foods, if by ""processed"" you mean ""exclusively McDonalds"" then yes, perhaps we will have some negative health impacts. However, many normal healthy foods are heavily processed. Consider whole grain bread, pasta, nuts, yogurt, etc (4) Why would you support factory farming?

The steak comes from a cow, the bacon from a pig, etc. They may not know which farm it comes from, but I would suspect that the same is true of an average person who buys a bag of spinach from the store.

nuclear energy,"I'm in favour for nuclear energy. For economical reasons, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Like my opponent said, nuclear power plants are expensive to build and we need to use energy for building it. But the main mistake that we make is we are looking too close to this subject. Nuclear power plant is an energy source which can give us highly more energy then others. If we compare a nuclear power plant with thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy will gain us what we lost while we're building the centrals. And the ending of the fossil fuels are really close(1). We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy has many radioactive wastes. But I think that we can agree on something: The worlds most important problem is Global Worming. It will destroy us slowly. And that's why we're our children to be careful and be aware of the effects of global warming. Now whit this fabulous energy type, we have a chance to and the global warming. For the effects of nuclear power plants, I need you to know that 95% of the energy generated by nuclear burn up is without any waste of CO2. So we should use nuclear energy to stop our biggest problem in the world. For the risks, Nuclear radiation is risky but the radiation will leave the central only if there is a crack in the central. We had seen it in Chernobyl, but now, we have a better technology and better scientist. We need to trust on our people to make this energy useful. Secondly., radiation is an important factor but we can't prove that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course it will effect the human health but ,we, people experience a lot of technological devices in our daily lives, like phones or televisions. Are we going to get rid of them just because of radiation? And the cancers are highly caused because of portable telephones, especially(2). Radars, satellite stations and microwave ovens operate also high radio frequencies. 1:http://www.forbes.com... 2:http://www.cancer.gov...",PRO,We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. ... 1:http://www.forbes.com... 2:http://www.cancer.gov...,840
nuclear energy,"In my opinion Nuclear Energy is necessary for countries. Before we discuss on energy or environmental effects, we need to make sure that nuclear energy is possible to use for all the countries. Of course, that will happen with money. When we look closer, nuclear energy makes a lot of difference in our world of economy. But if we look generally, it will gain us what we lost. Because the energy which is made by thermal power plant is a lot lesser than the nuclear energy. So we can say that the centrals of nuclear power is cost a lot but the energy we gain with that will equal the difference. Now for the environmental effects. Nuclear Energy isn't polluting the world as thermal power plants. Thermal energy causes the global warming which is the most important world discussion and the most dangerous natural disaster of our generation. There is not any carbon dioxide pollution with nuclear energy. So this energy do not emit harmful gases. Nuclear energy is an emission-free energy source because it does not burn anything to produce electricity. It does not cause any ground-level ozone formation, smog, and acid rain like thermal power plants.(1) I think that if we can use an energy type which harms our environment a lot and which does not produce enough energy as nuclear power, why can't we use nuclear power? Nuclear energy has a lot of risks, it is true and everybody knows it but in my opinion, mankind did a lot of dangerous things. We can't improve ourselves without taking risks. We are going to learn our mistakes for the future generations. We can look at Chernobyl disaster. The disaster really caused a lot of radioactive waste. But noting will work perfectly with the first try. The main risk of the nuclear power is the nuclear weapons. So if we stop using them, there is not any fatal risks. You can ask that ""if the reactor explodes.."", but the technology we use in past and in present, there is a huge difference between them. We can know and control what our abilities to do with nuclear powers. If we compare the energy made by thermal and nuclear, we will understand the difference. Of course there is renewable energy plants like solar or hydro but these are not making enough energy as nuclear power. A typical reactor of uranium convert 500.000mj/kg but for oil the number is just 45-46mj/kg(2). Also,we have to use 2 million grams of oil or 3 million grams of coal to equal the power contained in 1 gram of uranium fuel(3). To sum up, Nuclear energy is necessary for all the countries and it is likely more useful then other types of power plants. I wish my best lucks to my opponent 1.http://www.fi.edu... 2.http://www.world-nuclear.org... 3.http://occupywallst.org...",PRO,Thermal energy causes the global warming which is the most important world discussion and the most dangerous natural disaster of our generation. ...

nuclear energy,"Sorry for the argument delay. My final argument is more about risks. Before talking about the risks, we can say that Nuclear power plants cost a lot for building them but it will recover energy and regain the money we lost. Nuclear power plants produce highly more energy then other energy plants. For the risks, I want to quote from the subject which is ""Nuclear Energy for COUNTRIES"". In Europe there are 185 nuclear centrals (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Russian Federation, UK...)(1) And I would like to remind you that every thermal or nuclear power plant can explode or pollute the world. So If we are arguing about countries, and we are, we need to look to the subject from another point of view. Imagine that you are a president of a country which exists in Europe and which doesn't have any nuclear power plant. But the country still has risks because of the other countries nuclear centrals. So that country has the risks of nuclear damage but not from their nuclear centrals, from different countries nuclear centrals. So that country can build their own centrals and use them. We can't demand other countries to close their centrals because, like France, Nuclear energy is their biggest energy sources (France: 58nuclear reactors, 63,130 MWe)(2) Moreover; Nuclear energy is a prove that science is still advancing. If we say no to this wonderful gift of science, we will stop the evolution of science. Don't stop the Nuclear Energy for future generations...

nuclear energy,"My first argument is that a nuclear reactor can't explode as a nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapons require uranium-235 or plutonium-239. When the nucleus splits, the huge energy comes from the enormous forces that hold the nucleus together. To split the nucleus of uranium, all you have to do is hit it gently with a neutron. When a nucleus is broken, the pieces fly apart with great energy. The energetic breakup is called fission. Typically, two large fission fragments and two additional neutrons fly out. The extra neutrons fissions in other nearby nuclei. Four mour neutrons emerge, followed by 8, 16, 32 and so on. Each doubling is called a generation. The whole process is called a chain reaction. The kinetic energy of the fission fragments is turned into heat, vaporizing all nearby material, and that's what makes the explosion. Well, the physics of the nuclear reactor is very similar to that od nuclear bombs, that why people fear them. In both, the energy is released from a chain reaction of uranium-235 or plutonium-239. The bomb uses doubling to get all the fission to take place in a millionth of a second. In contrast, the reactor uses a sustained chain reaction, with no doubling (I skip the explaination on how this works just to make the argument shorter, if you want i can explain it). In the reactor fission releases two or three neutrons, but on average only one of those goes on to hit another nucleus and trigger another fission, so the rate of reaction doesn't grow. Energy is released at a constant rate, heats water, and produces steam, which in turn runs a turbine that runs a generator that produces electricity. A nuclear reactor CANNOT explode like an atomic bomb. The physics reason for the safety of the nuclear power reactor is the fact that the presence of lots of the uranium-238 in the core means that the nuclear chain reaction will stop if the neutrons are not moderated. Unless the neutron are slowed down, they will be absorbed by uranium-238 and the chain reaction will cease. This are the physics involved in the nuclear power. I explained it as simply as I could and without making it to long to read it. To finish my argument, i would like to repeat my main idea: Nuclear reactor can't explode as an atomic bomb does.",PRO,"My first argument is that a nuclear reactor can't explode as a nuclear weapon.

nuclear energy,"While nuclear power it is often proclaimed as clean this does not mean it is a renewable resource like wind, wave, or solar power. Nuclear power plants use uranium to produce energy, which, of course, needs to be mined. Currently only 2.3% of uranium used in reactors in EU is mined in the EU[1]. Moreover, the world’s main uranium deposits are located outside the EU. The use of nuclear energy thus undermines energy self-sufficiency of the EU. This may pose a serious threat to the future. Natural (and other) resources are usually used as the first intermediates of diplomatic disputes. When a country wants to exert diplomatic pressure on another country (or bloc of countries like EU), trade bans or embargos are widely used. For example in 2009 Russia stopped gas supply to Ukraine due to trade dispute between their two national gas companies. Therefore, the supply of uranium may be susceptible to diplomatic and trade relations (which are often volatile) and consequently nuclear power may not be reliable. Is it one of the aims of the EU to become less dependent on imported material needed for energy production.[2] As a non renewable resource we also need to think about the possibility of supplies running out. The concept of ‘peak uranium’ is sometimes overblown but there is only a 230 years supply of uranium at current consumption rates. If the price gets high enough then there are other options for production, including from seawater, but this would clearly mean a big increase in cost and concerns that producers will try to keep cheaper uranium to themselves and export for much higher prices.[3] Thus over longer term the nuclear energy may become far more expensive, or even unavailable due to lack of fuel.

I believe that the United States of America should increase the nuclear energy production for the following reasons.

nuclear energy,"I'll try and rebuttal my opponent's arguments as best I can. 1) My opponent claims that nuclear energy more jobs than other sources. I believe this to be very incorrect. For starters, nuclear power plants require professional scientists over blue collar workers, meaning that it's availability for jobs is significantly decreased. As a result, the average plant only employs 400-700 people, with maybe 3500 temporary jobs for constructing the plant itself (http://www.nei.org...). This is pretty low compared to other renewable sources such as solar power plants that offer jobs in the 1000s. 2) My opponent uses the proposed space elevator as a solution to nuclear waste (a thing that he apparently blows off as not a big problem as well). First off, nuclear waste is a huge problem with power plants since they require highly radioactive elements (such as Plutonium) to operate. The subsequent radioactive waste produced often has a high half-life (time it takes to decay to half its self), with the average element taking at least 1000 years (and that's being generous). Storing it is a huge political and environmental problem as even with places such as Yucca Mountain, there is still more waste (and more continuing to be produced) than places to store it. My opponent states that space elevator will solve this dilemma. Let me just say that while the space elevator is a decent solution to the problem, we are still decades away from constructing it. The space elevator is literally an elevator into space. Financing it would be a huge problem in the UN, not to mention the fact that technology to construct it is still out of bounds. The links my opponent provided only clarify that scientists have all the materials, but what is an ingredient w/o a recipe? There is also the fact that this elevator has many problems of its own such as withstanding the conditions of space (I believe metal can only be in space for 10 years before having to be replaced b/c of the cold, but don't quote me on that), adjusting to the Earth's constant rotation, adapting to the sun's heat when close by, and collisions with other space materials among others. Right now, we can't just wait until all these problems are solved. Nuclear waste needs to be dealt with in another, more viable manner. 3) I will concede to my opponent the point on space required. However, the costs of building a nuclear power plant are very expensive as it costs about $8.5 billion to construct (and that's not even taking into account decommising costs) compared to say a solar power plant that costs about $1.65 billion. I eagerly await my opponents response.",CON,This is pretty low compared to other renewable sources such as solar power plants that offer jobs in the 1000s. ...

nuclear energy,"Nuclear power has too many problems. Nuclear power plants can not be brought on line fast enough to prevent the rapid climate change disaster coming in less than 10 years (See Shootout: Do We Need To Restrict CO2 Emissions? ). Greenhouse gases are emitted throughout the nuclear fuel chain, from mining the uranium, its enrichment, transportation and the construction of the plants. Nuclear plants are too expensive. They cost at least $6 billion each. They can potentially have catastrophic radiological releases in case of a serious accident or a terrorist attack from the piles of radioactive waste stored at each site. Use of nuclear power by the U.S. will encourage nuclear proliferation by third-world countries and often leads to nuclear weapon development and the risk of nuclear war. There are cleaner, safer and cheaper alternatives available that can produce our electricity without using nuclear or fossil fuels. All reactors release radiation into the air, water and soil. Our national standards are inadequate in protecting the workers or our most vulnerable citizens, our children. Reactors, with the piles of nuclear materials, are prime terrorists targets. They are not protected nearly as well enough. The entire nuclear fuel chain generates lots of long-lasting radioactive waste.

nuclear energy,"Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not use more nuclear energy for 4 main reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organism that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, Via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, Currently we are not sure the long term affects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have no been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, But there have been ""sightings"" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, That it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency upon nuclear energy there will be a growing need, This is not good because our storage places are limit right now. The cost of nuclear energy is on the rise, From 2002 to 2009 the cost per plant has raised by five to seven billion dollars. This is the cost to begin the construction of a nuclear power plant and doesn't take into consideration the cost of fuel, Maintenance and physical running cost, Let alone real estate and storage cost.

While the number of reactors may increase the consumption of uranium may well actually go down as the next generation of reactors will get more energy from the uranium they use. More specifically fourth generation reactors would reuse the uranium multiple times up to the point where they may be more than a hundred times more fuel efficient than current reactors.[1] Furthermore, uranium is not mined only in one specific country, but in variety of countries (Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, Russia, Niger, United States). As we can see, these countries differ from each other in any way – political situation, regime, relationships with other countries etc. Therefore, even in the case of war with one or few countries from where uranium is obtained, the supply can be established from other sources, other countries. Therefore, there is a very little possibility of diplomatic pressure, since uranium can be obtained from variety of sources. Together with thorium, which can be obtained from countries like India, Turkey, Brazil, EU can be considered as independent from any one source of uranium or thorium.

nuclear energy,"In order not to harm environment, not to cause climate changes, renewable power plants (wind, water, solar) should be used. However, these do not work together with nuclear power plants. Nuclear plants – giant very hot machines – are designed to operate at full speed (85%) all the time. They are not designed to change the output quickly. Since they are very expensive to build, they are not economic unless operated at full speed (also turning off and on is expensive). Solar and wind power plants are not stable (output varies because of natural factors) and thus need a backup, called a baseload. Nuclear plants are not a good backup for renewables. We need nimble plants in order to support wind and solar plants. Nuclear power stations do not work with solar, wind and water power stations, because they are running at full speed all the time (because of economic and technical reasons). Instead gas plants that can be powered up and down as required are needed to balance power generation. If we want to move towards Green World – nuclear energy does not help us to do so.[1] It is generally agreed that we want more renewable power generation in Europe even if there are disagreements about where plants should be situated or how much must come from renewable sources. The European Union aims to have 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020.[2] And if it is to meet CO2 reduction targets far more will be needed in following decades. Nuclear is also not as helpful as renewables in meeting these CO2 reduction targets. It is estimated that renewables produce 10-40g of CO2 pre kWh of electricity produced, but nuclear is currently much higher at 90-140g/kWh, though still only a tenth of coal.

He also makes note of the disaster in Japan. (1) This was not because of a problem with Nuclear reactors but a problem in withholding high standards. These standards are getting met by the U.S.A. and no nuclear damage from sandy is proof. 3) If several stations are commissioned at once, then the cost should go down because of economies of scale - a sort of bulk discount. (2) Once built, nuclear power plants have advantages. In a gas-fired plant, the gas alone makes up 80% of the cost of electricity. So firms and consumers are very exposed to the wholesale price of gas.But at a nuclear power plant, the fuel is processed uranium, accounting for just 10% of the cost of production.

nuclear energy,"This debate in essence has come down to a couple main topics: waste, economics of plants, and claims made by my opponents(sorry for being broad). Before I move on to those points I believe it's also important that I point out how my opponent never used one piece of evidence throughout the debate. Now moving onto the arguments. Waste I refuted my opponent's claims about waste throughout the debate with evidence. You could use thorium based reactors, which effectively reduce waste to a minuscule amount, in tandem with blowing this waste into glass to extremely reduce the amount of waste and contain it. Which my opponent never responded to. Economics of plants My opponent spoke about how plants cost a lot to construct, which is true. But using evidence from the EIA I showed that an overall lifetime system levelized cost which takes into consideration everything associated with constructing and running a plant, nuclear falls in the middle of the pack. On top of this using the same EIA evidence I also spoke about the capacity factor (how much of the US power grid a certain form of energy can power), I showed that capacity factor for nuclear was much higher then all of the counterparts which my opponent proposed. Meaning that even if nuclear costs a little more, it's still much more viable power source. I also refuted my opponent's point about subsidies using evidence from the NEI showing how the subsidies nuclear receives aren't any greater the other forms of energy and also aren't as bad as my opponents suggested. Claims made by my opponent Because this topic is a little broad I should clarify. Throughout the debate my opponent made claims without any evidence that were either false, fear mongering, or had some other issue. So, I what they were and where in this debate you can see my refutation of these points. Nuclear plants are essentially nuclear bombs waiting to happen/fallout fear mongering My refutation for this is during my round 2 response. I essentially talk about how this extremely unlikely this would be to occur and is mainly fear mongering on my opponent's part, also I gave evidence about how a nuclear meltdown's harm wouldn't be too significant.

nuclear energy,"Howdy. Before I get started, I'd like to say that this is my first debate on this website, so please forgive me for any oddities or broken unofficial rules. I'd really appreciate any tips anyone can leave in the comments; thanks! First, Nuclear Energy is better than current energy sources. If we switch to nuclear power over traditional coal and natural gas power plants, the over 5 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions in the US alone (1) could be reduced to almost nothing, which creates a healthier environment and solves global warming (2). Contrary to popular belief, Nuclear power creates ""zero harmful emissions"" and fossil fuel emissions actually correlate much more strongly with cancer rates (3). The cost of nuclear is also comparative with that of conventional fuels (4), and prices are less likely to fluctuate due to foreign oil booms or downturns. By turning to nuclear, we can save the planet and keep our energy needs domestic, which makes us less reliant on other countries for energy. Second, Nuclear Energy is better than renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. While all three energy producers have had technology available for decades, nuclear energy currently accounts for 20% of the nation's energy production while the heavily subsidized renewable energy sector accounts for only 2% (5). The world's energy demand is increasing rapidly, and there's no way renewables can keep up. While solar panels and wind farms take up massive fields (wind farms even slaughter birds and destroy migration patterns), nuclear energy is extremely space-efficient for the same amount of energy. With a constantly growing population, space is a valuable resource that we shouldn't be wasting on solar and wind power when there's a better option. In addition, nuclear material is in such great supply that it's virtually a renewable- we won't run out for centuries, and more efficient methods are constantly being developed (6). Nuclear is a nearly bottomless resource that is the only way we can sustainably keep up with rising demands for energy and space. (1) http://www.eia.gov... (2) http://www.scientificamerican.com...

nuclear energy,"I forfeited round 3 in an effort to even out my opponent's forfeiture of Round 3. Now he has forfeited Round 5. Though my opponent provided some ""cons"" to the ""pros"" of the use of nuclear energy, he has not provided any concrete reasons as to why the United States should not significantly increase it's use of nuclear energy. In fact, his contentions- a significant increase would only raise use by 20% max by 2050; demand for energy will increase; etc. are in favor of a significant increase of the use of nuclear energy when we take into consideration his main con- the environment. Nuclear energy is not the safest method for producing energy according to my opponent. Indeed uranium is much more hazardous than coal, but how many people have died in uranium mines compared to those who have died in coal mines? (http://www.world-nuclear.org...) Thousands of Navajo Indians have died mining uranium. This must be acknowledged. But looking at the above information- 5,000 annual deaths in China due to coal mining, thousands dead throughout history in the US, let alone the other accidents associated with the production of energy, nuclear is the safest because the material is the most dangerous forcing companies to take strenuous precautions. The effects of nuclear energy on the environment have been weighed. It is one of the safest and most efficient means of producing energy. It is cheaper energy than coal, it employs technology that is further developed than a massive increase in solar, wind, and hydro energy, and it is amongst the lowest in carbon emissions. Yes- we need to develop safer ways to store and recycle spent rods. Yes, we need to develop safer ways to transport and mine uranium. Yes, we need to find safer ways to cool reactors. The need for development of technology BEFORE significantly increasing the use of nuclear energy does not mean we should not do it. A significant increase would be in harmony with my opponent's contention that it is only possible to raise production by 20% of the total. Current use is at 17% in the US, and a raise in 20% by 2050 is a more than 100% increase- especially if demand rises (to maintain current market share levels). He claims an increase of solar and wind is possible to raise it to 39% by 2050. Great! Those are also essential pieces of the energy pie! In conclusion, in order for the US to accomplish energy independence, security, lower energy costs, and improve greenhouse emissions- the United States should significantly increase its use of nuclear energy.

You will probably mention a catastrophic incident such as Fukushima however most of these incidents happened in extreme circumstances such as hurricanes, tsunami's or earthquakes which are all unavoidable natural hazards. Almost any type of power plant we create is vulnerable to the weather: solar panels need sunlight, wind turbines need wind, etc. There is unfortunately no renewable energy source which doesn't, in some shape or form, rely on something temperamental ergo nuclear, whilst somewhat dangerous, is still a far more rewarding and optimal way to produce electricity.

nuclear energy,"Britain wants to prevent a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees, this would involve limiting greenhouse gas concentration to 450 ppm of CO2-eq. World energy-related CO2 emissions would need to drop sharply from 2020 onwards, reaching less than 26 Gt in 2030. Nobuo Tanaka, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency has stated “We would need concerted action from all major emitters. Our analysis shows that OECD countries alone cannot put the world onto a 450-ppm trajectory, even if they were to reduce their emissions to zero”.[[ New Energy Realities – WEO Calls for Global Energy Revolution Despite Economic Crisis, 12th November 2008, http://www.iea.org/textbase/press/pressdetail.asp?PRESS_REL_ID=275%5D%5D This would mean that Britain and the rest of the developed world would need to take radical measures to get to this point. Once the whole nuclear power cycle is taken into account including uranium mining, processing, transportation, power station construction and decommissioning Nuclear Power plants do not produce less CO2 emissions than gas. Moreover, due to declining quantities of uranium more energy is required to produce and exploit the uranium fuel than can be generated from it. Mining lower quality ore will increase carbon emissions because it is more difficult to extract and so requires more energy. Assuming world nuclear generating capacity remains at 2005 levels, after about 2016 the mean grade of uranium ore will fall significantly from today’s levels, and even more so after 2034. After about 60 years the world nuclear power system will fall off the ‘Energy Cliff’ – meaning that the nuclear system will consume as much energy as can be generated from the uranium fuel. So if new nuclear power stations are built then they will only be half way through their life cycle before they become useless.[[ Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen, Energy Security and Uranium reserves, July 2006 http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/publications/briefing_papers/pdf/energyfactsheet4.pdf%5D%5D",PRO,"Britain wants to prevent a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees, this would involve limiting greenhouse gas concentration to 450 ppm of CO2-eq.

nuclear energy,"I am so so sorry. I hate to forfeit. Rebuttals: ""Contrary to popular belief, Nuclear power creates 'zero harmful emissions'"" Though it may not cause harmful emissions, it can still be incredibly dangerous. The radioactive waste can possess a threat to the environment and is dangerous for humans[1]. A famous example is the Chernobyl accident, where the harmful effects of nuclear radiation on humans affected around 600,000 people. Estimates conclude that somewhere between 15,000 and 30,000 people lost their lifes in the Chernobyl aftermath and more than 2.5 million Ukrainians are still struggling with health problems related to nuclear waste[1]. Just last year, on March 18, a major nuclear crisis happenend again in Japan, again causing major uproar and even restricting trade[3]. While the casualties were not as high as with the Chernobyl accident, the environmental effects were disastrous. History shows that we can never really be fully protected against these disasters, so nuclear power is not safe[1]. In contrast, solar power is 100% eco friendly and not harmful[4]. ""Nuclear Energy is better than renewable energy sources like solar power."" ""There's no way renewables can keep up."" ""Nuclear is a nearly bottomless resource."" Renewable energy sources are much more safe, and also extremely plentiful as they're always available and always will be[4]. There are many, many more advantages to solar power over nuclear as well[5], including throwing away the need for a house to be hooked up to a power grid as it does using nuclear energy. In fact, nuclear power tied for last in a list created by Stanford University's published Mark Jacobson[6]. Also, the US has tons of solar power resources and the production of more provides jobs[4].

nuclear energy,"OK, I know someone just did something like this, but I like the idea and I like to argue about nuclear power, so yeah. Please no stealing arguments from that debate, or at least as little as possible and in your own words. Thank you! OK, the United States currently uses mainly (51%) coal power [1] and this causes, among other things, acid rain, smog, lung damage, contamination of lakes and rivers, birth defects, and radiation releases. (Now, you'll say nuclear energy releases more, but I'll cover that later, so hold on.) This all comes from the tens of thousands of TONS of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, ash, sludge, mercury and other chemicals. These are harmful to our environment and the people of the United States. Nuclear energy can reduce this harm if it is used to gradually reduce or eliminate the use of coal and other fossil-fuels. This is because nuclear energy produces virtually no air pollution [3] and nuclear energy actually produces 100 times less radiation than does coal [4]. But all that is just from producing energy, what about getting the fuel? Well, we would mine less if we used uranium for power, as you'd need less uranium to produce the same amount of energy, 20,000 times less to be exact [5]. All these advantages of nuclear power mentioned are good, but they only cover health and the environment. Let's expand the view of this debate to look at other advantages of nuclear energy, specifically economics. Nuclear plants can create up to 1,800 temporary jobs and 1,400 permanent jobs. They can also generate $430 million for local economies [6] and this is only looking at the plants themselves, not at manufacturing parts, research, or other industries that would be stimulated. Now let's look at the costs of building and maintaining. Nuclear plants cost less overall than does the advanced type of coal with sequestration that is now being researched and is the future of coal [7]. And, while coal is increasing cost [8], nuclear will lower in cost because of advancing technology [9]. So basically, coal has a lot of problems, while nuclear power is safe, economical, and good for our country. Thank you and I look forward to a response. [1]: http://leahy.senate.gov...

nuclear energy,"As this is a debate with an equal BOP, I assume we go with a normal 4 round Format R1) Acceptance and Definitions R2) Contention R3) Rebuttals R4) Closing Arguments C1: Nuclear Power Plants have a risk of High Environmental and Societal Damage [1][2] Nuclear Power Plants always come at a high risk for a disaster. Almost any environmental change or Natural Disaster could lead to the plant not producing nearly as much energy, could close the plant, or, even worse, could leak out radiation. This was seen recently with the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster last year. Some, but not all of the environmental changes and natural disasters that would alter Nuclear Power Plants are: Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tropical Depressions/Storms/Hurricanes, Heat Waves, Reduced Precipitation Levels, Tornadoes, and Hurricanes.These environmental changes and natural disasters occur almost every place in the United States[3]. Seawater is also highly corrosive to Nuclear Power Plants, so it is Extremely Dangerous to put it on an ocean coast. Nuclear Power Plants themselves don't produce CO2, but all other parts of the Nuclear Fuel Chain, mining, milling, transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management, all require Fossil Fuels, hence those other parts all produce CO2. Also, it would be quite a challenge to dispose even more Nuclear Waste. Decommissioning the plant safely would be occupationally dangerous, as would working in a Nuclear Power Plant. C2: Nuclear Power Plants are Uneconomical[1][2] Nuclear Power Plants require high capital costs to build them. True, during the expected Nuclear Power Plant lifetime of 60 years, that Nuclear Energy is cheap itself, but you have to also pay all of the workers, and you would have to pay them a lot, since you are working with Uranium. It also requires money and Fossil Fuels to fulfill the rest of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle. Once the Nuclear Energy stops producing energy, Nuclear Plants have to go through a process of Decommisioning, which normally costs $300 Million-$5 Billion per plant, as you have to pay the workers to decommision the plant, and you have to fulfill certain standards to decommision, which also requires a lot of money. The process of Decommisioning also takes a long time, as no Nuclear Plant in the U.S. has finished Decommisioning. C3: No Fossil Fuel Independence[2] America has recently been trying to break away from Fossil Fuels. Nuclear Energy would not give us Fossil Fuel Independence. All other parts of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle require Fossil Fuels to run. Therefore, we still have to pay money to import oil and other Fossil Fuels from other countries. Nuclear Energy is not the way to break away from Fossil Fuels. Other power sources break away from Fossil Fuels, such as Wind Turbines and Solar Panels[4][5] Sources: [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org...

The results were disturbing. According to the report European power plants are not well prepared for an emergency situation. Some of the power plants would have less than hour to restore safety systems in case of electric blackout.[1] Currently more than 100,000 citizens live in proximity (30 km) of 111 reactors. Should anything go wrong, many lives would be endangered. The problems could be resolved by dramatic investments into the safety measures. However, these investments would require approximately €25 bn[2]. This is a sum indebted European Union cannot afford.

nuclear energy,"Thanks for accepting the LonelyMoutain. I will be presenting my arguments in this round. Good luck! This is the first time I did this topic, and I'm making this debate just to see if the topic is good. Argument 1: Good for the environment Nuclear Power is good for the environment. Nuclear Power gives nearly zero amount of greenhouse gases [1] [2]. In 1998, there was a study that the greenhouse gases reduced around 50% percent because of nuclear power [2]. It is the safest way to get energy, and won't harm the environment, because it doesn't release C02 or methane, which is the main impact of greenhouse gases. Because it produces no greenhouse gases, and helps the environment more than burning fuels, and fossil fuels, countries ought to allow the production of nuclear power. Argument 2: Powerful and Reliable My second argument is about Nuclear Power being powerful and reliable. It's more powerful than other energy resources, because of the good technology. Also, it is reliable because it has over 91% of efficiency rate, and it works on 24/7, unlike wind or solar power, it can also be used in harsh weather. Because Nuclear Power is powerful and reliable, I affirm. Argument 3: Cheap This is one of the main reasons why countries prefer nuclear power to solar power, etc. Nuclear Power is cheaper than Solar Power. Solar Power is also good for the environment, but people don't use them much because they are very expensive. But with Nuclear Power, the energy and electricity is cheaper than other energy resources, like wind and solar power. Because cheapness, which affects why people like nuclear power, and it is preferred over solar power, countries should ought to allow the production of nuclear power.' Argument 4: Supply My last argument will be about supply, and of how much nuclear power there is. Unlike nuclear power, fossil fuels are nonrenewable energy resources, meaning we will use them up one day, and there will be none left. We use them faster than making them. However, with Nuclear Power that is not the case. Because of lots of supply, countries should allow the production of nuclear power Conclusion I showed many different ways Nuclear Power being effective, it is cheap, lots of amount, and helps the environment.

For example: nuclear fusion is estimated to power city for around 150 billion years for a very small amount of deuterium. The nuclear energy used today is known as nuclear fission, a process that releases large amounts of energy in short periods of time. Although nuclear fission is not as sufficient as nuclear fusion, it still powers 6% of the worlds energy production. The benefits of nuclear fission can be applied to several technologies, like weapons, transportation, ect. Just to clarify, nuclear fusion is not used today because of a single problem, it is very difficult to contain the fusion process because of the large amount of heat and radiation that is released. However there are elements, that can create nuclear fusion and are in abundance on the moon, like helium 3.

Such a tragedy as the Fukushima accident caused a lot of deaths due to the melting of 3 nuclear reactors, which caused a nuclear accident. What happened after this? 1,000 people died from the accident while people maintained the evacuation. What happens when a tragedy strikes places in Europe? Reactors have a chance of going down and melting. Radiation is likely to occur when a power plant would melt. And what happens if a reactor goes down. People are very likely to die. http://www.world-nuclear.org... According to a idebate.org, there are more than 100,000 citizens that live in proximity (30 kilometers) of 111 nuclear reactors. 100,000 citizens tried to evacuate in the Fukushima accident, and 10,000 died. So as for Europe, 100,000 citizens for every 111 nuclear reactors would have to evacuate if a tragedy like an earthquake happened, which is possible. For the past 10 days, there have been several strong earthquakes in the past 18 days of Europe. One example shows how there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 in Greece, which also appears to have a lot of earthquakes. This shows that there is a chance that an earthquake could cause damage to a reactor, which is a building. Earthquakes within the range of 6-7 can cause damage to buildings, and it is a distinct possibility that the nuclear energy inside could blow up and emit radiation, which is capable of killing people. http://idebate.org... http://www.emsc-csem.org... https://en.wikipedia.org... Considering the high amount of reactors and the amount of citizens that live close to them, a tragedy such as an earthquake can cause at least a thousand deaths.

nuclear energy,"Nuclear power is no better placed to deliver the amount of energy required. There is an unrealistic focus on nuclear power as a magical solution to climate change. Despite increasing demand the amount of electricity being generated by nuclear is projected to fall not rise. The share of nuclear energy will decrease from 30% to 25% in electricity generation by 2020. According to current projections, the nuclear generation capacity in the EU would fall by as much as 33 GWe by 2020; this fall would mostly have to be met by dirty power plants using gas, or particularly coal [1]. The focus on nuclear power diverts attention from other renewables. In reality going nuclear would squeeze out renewables. Indeed, the former Secretary of State for Business Patricia Hewitt said in a Commons debate on a 2003 Energy White Paper: 'It would have been foolish to announce …. that we would embark on a new generation of nuclear power stations because that would have guaranteed that we would not make the necessary investment and effort in both energy efficiency and in renewables'[2].

At the same time world energy consumption is projected to expand by 50% from 2005 to 2030 leading to high oil and gas prices[2]. The production of renewable energy is not growing at a fast enough pace to replace fossil fuels; wind, wave and solar simply cannot provide the quantities of energy required.

nuclear energy,"Sorry, I've been cruising around in the Caribbean for the past week. I thought I'd have internet, but I didn't. So this'll just have to become a 2-round debate. You're definitely right that coal and oil aren't going to serve us much longer. We're fast reaching the end of the earth's supply of oil. Soon we're going to have to find a different, renewable source of energy to keep us alive and driving our cars. But I don't think the predominant one will be wind energy. Ever notice that the only places that really utilize wind for electricity are small, rural villages? The reason is simple: wind energy just doesn't provide a lot of energy. Huge fields of windmills are only enough to power small towns. How many windmills do you think it would take to power a metropolis like New York? I'm not sure what will top out as the best new energy source when oil hits the can, but I think it will probably be nuclear, at least until we run out of fuel for that too. Nuclear reactions create a HUGE amount of power, and if we ever figure out how to make a sustained fusion reaction, we'll have an endless supply of very powerful fuel. >Wind energy is the best available energy because it will never run out. Neither will solar, hydro, geothermal, etc. >All other energy's will either run out or are way to expensive to start up and keep running. Not really. It might not be too expensive to make a few hundred windmills for a rural village, but the costs of building and maintaining enough windmills to sustain the whole world (we're talking millions and millions) would be a lot. On the other hand, for example, it is very cheap to put a power plant in a dam or waterfall capable of powering a small city. >Some other energy's are bad for the environment and will make the world a worse place than it is and will be with using fossil fuels. I'm assuming you're referring chiefly to nuclear, which has seen a few unfortunate disasters over history. But nuclear energy is only dangerous when power plants are poorly maintained or some nutjob throws radioactive isotopes into the ocean. Today's federal regulations make another disaster like Three Mile Island extremely unlikely. >Also, some people are too busy with work and handling kids that they don't have time to try to make a difference in the world and change what energy sources we are using most frequently.

nuclear energy,"In many senses nuclear energy is clean. It does not produce gaseous emissions such as greenhouse gases, which are harmful either to the population or to the environment. It is true that it does produce radioactive waste. Since this is in solid form it can be dealt with much more easily and stored away from centres of population. The damage caused to the environment and populations due to the burning of fossil fuels is far in excess of the damage done to the environment due to the nuclear industry including even the Chernobyl catastrophe. In this sense nuclear energy is very much preferable to the burning of fossil fuels at the moment. Furthermore, as new technology becomes available to allow the more efficient use of nuclear fuel, less nuclear waste will be produced. (A recent example is the development of the fast breeder reactor, which uses fuel much more efficiently.) However, this trend will only continue with investment. Judging from the pace of development of nuclear technology since its inception it is fair to say that with more investment nuclear energy will become an even more desirable source of energy with many of its current drawbacks curtailed. The high price of oil at present looks set to continue, and makes the economic case for investment in nuclear power even more attractive.",PRO,The damage caused to the environment and populations due to the burning of fossil fuels is far in excess of the damage done to the environment due to the nuclear industry including even the Chernobyl catastrophe. ...

In response to the first point you have produced nuclear power and the bi-products of the process as one and the same and the use of word i would reinforce my point as that the lack of nuclear power being developed as a primary source of energy, has allowed the production of energy from fossil fuels has caused more pollution, Carbon and sulfur emissions from fossil fuels causing acid rain, and the absorption of Carbon dioxide into water cause changes in pH damaging ecosystems. Whereas the only radioactive waste products from nuclear fission based reactor technology has had a relatively small impact globally. I would also state the define that by stating in your response that nuclear technology is an abstract idea seem to be come confusion for you for as far as I'm aware nuclear technology is and has been a reality for over 60 years now, and hence it is no longer an idea. I argue that the power which can be produced from a nuclear reactor is worth producing the radioactive waste. In response to your second point If you can reference a majority of points which show global damage done by these accidents at nuclear reactors, then i will cede my point. However, as the only major incidents in history of nuclear power are Chernobyl and Green Mile Island, in these incidents radioactive materials were dispersed into the atmosphere, however asides from in the locality of the incidents no long term damage has been proven. I will aslo like to preempt that the incidents with nuclear reactors in Japan can not be contributed to flaws in the nuclear technology but due to extreme damage caused by a random act of God. I would also hasten to point out that the amount of incidents that involve in death of work or costs over $540000 dollars is not confined to the nuclear industry but is common place in oil industries, i need only quote the deep water horizon incident in which lives of works were lost, and the cost of clean-up into billions of dollars, likewise the damage to the ecosystem is severe. And finally in response to your third point i would argue that in order for you to win on this point you would have to present a feasible technology that could produce power of the same magnitude as that produce by nuclear reactor technology.

Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government. Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power. Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist. Donald Trump's asinine claims about Mexican criminals being ""rapists"" and ""murderers"" are akin to the Sith's attempts to criminalize the Jedi near the fall of the Old Republic.

donald trump,"I would like to bring attention to some factors that I believe were important in Donald Trump's victory, that will likely not be present in the 2020 elections. First, Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, was also very unpopular. For most of the campaign she too was below 50% popularity. This shows in some of the closest states in the 2016 election: Michigan--0.3%, New Hampshire--0.4%, Wisconsin--1%, Pennsylvania--1.2%, and so on. Two unpopular candidates led to very close margins. However, when we look at Trump’s approval rating, for the most part he has gotten less and less popular since winning the Presidency. There’s been a minor uptick in popularity, but he’s had similar short term fluctuations previously. Meanwhile it cannot be assumed that the Democratic challenger will be as unpopular as Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. So what we are likely to see is that while Donald Trump enters the 2020 election with even lower popularity than in 2016, his opponent will likely enter with higher popularity than Hillary Clinton. With the razor thin margins Trump won by in several states, such a shift could easily give the state to the Democrats. Related is that Hillary Clinton was under a very public investigation throughout the election. That, along with the last minute revelation of the investigation restarting also hurt her chances in the general election. In effect in the 2016 election, Donald Trump was running on easy mode against a candidate that even a majority her own party didn’t like or trust, yet still just barely beat out his opponent in multiple states. Against a more popular and trusted candidate, Donald Trump is highly unlikely to win in 2020. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com... http://abcnews.go.com... http://abcnews.go.com...",PRO,"I would like to bring attention to some factors that I believe were important in Donald Trump's victory, that will likely not be present in the 2020 elections.  ...

What is a politician, someone that lies, that says stuff the public wants to hear and they smoothen out the corners. Trump doesn't do that. He is clear and said what he wanted to say.

donald trump,"Rebuttals ""Donald Trump has shown no instance, or given any evidence for us to believe, that he can actually use the dark side of the force. As this is a prerequisite to being a Sith, much less a Sith Lord, it's on Pro to give us evidence that he can actually wield the force."" Here's the problem with this statement. The sith never displayed their power in a public area. Take Darth Plageuis for example. He, to the common person, was a banker; he never let his true identity become apparent to all but a select few (namely his Jedi adversaries and his apprentice). Darth Sidious is another example. To the public he was known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the benevolent leader of the Republic. His ability to wield the dark side of the Force was never revealed until he attempted to subdue Anakin Skywalker. The sith believe in secrecy and surprise; if the Jedi were aware that someone such as the Supreme Chancellor was a Sith Lord, they would have acted and taken him down. ""There's no evidence to believe that Donald Trump owns a light saber. Possessing a lightsaber is a key attribute of a force-wielder, and it's usually never absent from their person. If he owned one, we would know of it. Therefore, it falls on my opponent to show him possessing and being able to wield a lightsaber."" Not all Sith Lords wielded lightsabers. Darth Sidious in his original appearance never used one, he only used Force lightning. In the Dark Lord Trilogy, he states that ""the Sith had grown beyond the use of a lightsaber and they only continued using them as an insult to the Jedi more than anything else."" ""Those seeking to become a Sith Lord, per tradition, had to train and pass the Sith Academy course on Korriban, which consisted of various brutal tests and trials for Sith to overcome."" The Sith academy on Korriban became a mess of ruins by the time of the Clone Wars, only serving as a tomb for the Sith Lord Darth Bane. Donald Trump would not have had to attend the academy, as he was not even alive when the academy was in existence. Sith lords such as Darth Tenebrous, Plageuis, Maul, Dooku, Sidious, Vader, and more were brought up much after the academy's demise. ""those are hardly Sith garments"" Dark cloaks were the mark of the Sith, and his cloak as shown was inspired by Darth Vader, who had similar pauldrons and a cape. Many Sith however did not adhere to these garments, such as Darth Malak, Darth Sion, or Darth Talon; saying that Donald Trump's attire aren't Sith garments is unjustified.

donald trump,"Foreign policy- Donald Trump seems to advocate a hyper aggressive stance for defending America's standing in the world- an appealing image to many. Yet we must ask ourselves: Does Donald Trump have the experience necessary to defend our interests in the world? For world politics is not simply a chapter in The Art of the Deal. Donald Trump may claim himself to be a master negotiator- maybe only to Vladimir Putin. How will he galvanize support in a world where his policies are criticized and his reputation horrible? As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton approached foreign policy in a way completely separate from the bigotry and ignorance of the US' standing in the world that Donald Trump possesses. 2. Economic competition and policies- What Donald Trump significantly ignores is the shrinking American middle class, essentially the backbone of America. It is sure that Hillary Clinton will not repeat Obama's flawed policies geared towards his conception of the ""middle class""- the impoverished, low-income communities who don't generate economic capital. To prevent outsourcing of American jobs and bring our jobs back home, we must strengthen families and make big business suitable for the common American, instead of encouraging big business' layoff of thousands of workers. By ensuring that the common American has equal opportunity to thrive, Hillary Clinton solves for America's income inequality in a way that Obama couldn't. 3. Donald Trump as the ""anti-donor"" candidate- Donald Trump is a master salesman. In fact, he views whatever he does in his political career like a game of Monopoly. The simple point is this- a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for the upper-class, top 1% in America. Donald Trump's associates are the CEOs of modern day- the corrupt real estate moguls that threaten America's common people.

I think that he has made some bad decisions during his time as president, And is not serving the American people as they deserve. But first, Let's look at the official definition of perfect. perfect (adjective) having all the desirable elements, Qualities, Or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be. Donald Trump certainly does not have all the desirable elements of a president, As he has quite high levels of racism, And an ideal president would have no racism because they would need to be accepting of all their people. It is proven by the fact that: a) he has made many racist comments during his presidency b) his actions in building a 'big, Beautiful wall' shows that he wants no immigrants. This seems not to be politically based, But purely based on racist beliefs. Now, Let's take a less anti-Trump perspective. No human can ever be ""as good as it is possible to be"" because every human has flaws. In fact, Nothing can be truly perfect (except God, If you believe in God, But that's for another debate).

Folks, we cannot repeat what we have done in Iraq in Syria by sending ground troops. Everyone knows this except Donald Trump.

donald trump,"Rebuttal: Donald Trump is without a doubt a successful businessman, and is very knowledgeable about the economy. However, Donald Trump is not a politician. He may have what it takes to employ the people of his businesses, but that does not mean he will be able to find a way to employ the millions of Americans without a job(from a political standpoint). Trump has been proved to fail in many business situations as well; he is not all just success. Take a look at the scandal involving Trump University. At the start, Trump University violated the law of operating without proper license, according to the NYSED license code of conduct.[1] Given the fact that Trump had violated laws in order to make money suggests how Trump may not even be that great of a businessman in the end, considering that he has to break laws in order to make his fortune. (Not to mention, the numerous lawsuits upon Trump following the scandal). Due to these reasons, the argument that Trump would make a good president because of the fact that according to Pro, he is a ""good businessman"" is faulty. (Not to mention the fact that your contention is extremely superficial) Contention 2: Trump would not make a good president because he does not practice as he preaches. Trump says that as president, he will look to employ American workers, and find Americans specifically, jobs. This is a faulty Trump statement as he has even openly admitted that in his companies, he does not employ as many American workers as he should. Trump turned down 94 percent of job applicants from American workers.[1] Trump promises to get more Americans employed, but is that what truly wants?

donald trump,"Very true, many people believe that the sole reason they voted for Trump was because of his policies. Therefore, they believe they are not racist. Racism is a spectrum, not all racists are out there wearing white robes. You have to look at this debate from a different perspective. This election was more than just, Hillary vs. Donald Trump, it was bigger than a ""regular"" election. Like I stated previously, racism is a spectrum. When a person as a voter decided to vote for Donald Trump, they are voting for everything he stands for. You cannot vote, for a couple of his policies. This being said, when Donald Trump states he wants to create a ""Muslim registry"" when you vote for him; even if you don't agree with this ideology, you are still voting for the man who will follow through with this. The Klu Klux Klan voted for the Donald J. Trump and they publicly endorsed him. For many, this should unacceptable, but it wasn't. For many this should have been an ""aha"" moment, that Trump is racist. If you gave in and voted for him, you voted for a racist. You have become a bystander to the public racism that he endorses. Just because you don't take part in the KKK's rituals, and just because you may not go out and use racial slurs, doesn't change the fact that his racism wasn't a deal breaker. Even after all of this, you were still able to go out and vote for him. You accepted his racism, and that in itself is a racist act. Not to mention, the lack of empathy a voter must have for minorities if they voted for Donald Trump. I'll state it for a third time, there has to be a point in time where you say ""enough is enough"" there has to be a line, and for many Donald Trump crossed this line. For me, Hillary Clinton used a private email server, was it a good decision? No. Did she apologize? Yes. The fact that her email may be more susceptible to hacking was not a deal breaker for me. The whole issue with Benghazi has been investigated 863 times. The investigations were thorough, and Hillary Clinton was not found to be guilty of any wrongdoing. If she had said what Donald Trump had said, especially in a public setting it would have been a deal breaker for me and so many other people. That doesn't mean I would go out and vote for Trump, just as I wouldn't expect Trump voters to vote for Hillary. There are third party nominees, and constituents always have the option of not voting. So, if you really disagree with half of the things that he has to say, you don't have to vote for him.

donald trump,"Before I start, I would just like to ensure that this debate stays civilized and respectful for its entire duration. The last debated I had was on a much less political and ""touchy"" subject, but its contents were quite offensive for some. So, let's make sure that this one stays in the neutral zone. The definition of the word ""racist,"" according to the Oxford Dictionary, is ""a person who behaves violently towards people who belong to a different race, or who treats them unfairly."" Donald Trump definitely fits this description. The most notable of this racial profiling goes to Trump's mistreatment of immigrants. He has repeatedly stated that hispanic immigrants are bringing nothing but crime to the US society, and these statements can be found all around his speeches before and during his presidential run. On June 16, 2015, he started off his presidential campaign with a speech in which he labelled Mexican immigrants as ""rapists and criminals."" The full quote integrated from his presidential speech is ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" During his entire campaign, he has emphasized this sort of criminality that he is associating with immigrants, but does not pay the same amount of attention to crime amidst majority Americans, because of his racial profiling. That is definitely treating a group unfairly due to their ethnicity or, in other terms, racism. He has also proposed ""tagging"" muslim Americans, creating a database which would keep track of this minority group with no proof of guilt whatsoever. This is not hard to prove, and it is part of his campaign platform, according to his own website. That is a violation of basic constitutional rights, and the unfair treatment of minorities. He has also pledged to send refugees home, despite rigorous standards of security screening already in place. If that is not considered racism then I don't know what is. Also, you have to admit that Trump won the US elections with a strategy of divisiveness. Simply look at the recent increase in discrimination against minorities, even in schools. Donald Trump is certainly using this sort of ripping in the fabric of a multicultural society to gain popularity and to assert control.

donald trump,"Actually, I never said that I agree that there was racial bias in the company. I only said that any racial bias (which doesn't confirm there was racial bias, it's just a hypothetical statement) would be attributed to Fred Trump considering Donald Trump was only an apprentice in 1973. That being said, it would seem that Trump won the lawsuits. All Trump has to do was read the Fair Housing Act and advertise to minorities. 2. Yes, I agree that his role in the birther movement was inspired by Obama's ties to foreign countries. The birther movement revolves around the idea that Barack Obama was not born directly in America. Barack Obama was allegedly (not proven) born in Kenya because his mother was not allowed to travel by plane. His mother than took him back to Hawaii to register his birth. That's the story that spawned the birther movement. The real, original birther movement had little to nothing to do with his relationship to Muslims. Although I think the birther movement is absurd, considering Obama would still be a citizen of the United States, it's very misleading, meaning that one can easily fall for it. 3. By your logic, Trump wouldn't want immigrants (legal or otherwise) period. You said he would ease up on migration restrictions and paperwork if he were really pro-immigration. The thing is though, the restrictions and paperwork apply to immigrants from all over - meaning that racism is not involved. Furthermore, 'Mexican' is a nationality, and 'illegal immigrant' is a status, neither of which are races. That being said, you did not refute my argument that there have been 3 million arrests attributed to a population of only 11 million other than calling it 'disputable'. 4. Actually, I was referring to Gonzalo Curiel's society called La Raza Lawyers. I was not referring to Hispanics. Trump also clarified that he was talking about the society on the full interview featured on your source. 5. He's only banning those from countries with heavy influence of terrorism. What if terrorists infiltrated the United States as refugees as they did in Europe? I don't think a Muslim ban from countries with high terrorist influence is racist, I think it is common-sense. The Holocaust is completely different from the Muslim ban. The Holocaust consisted of the killing of Jews, where most of them were innocent people. The Muslim ban is a temporary way to prevent terrorists from getting into our country. 6. Just because racists like him, doesn't make him racist. By that logic, any politician who had racists support them or racists become inspired by them would be racist themself. Thanks for this debate.

donald trump,"Since pro agrees with my sentiments, there isn't much room for debate. However, I will state a few reasons why I believe the way I do. Point Number One In the 2008 and 2012 elections where Barack Obama won both, an overwhelming majority of blacks voted for him. The numbers across the board was above 90% of the black voters voted for him. If the same percentage of blacks voted for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump would not have won. The same goes for women voters. Donald Trump won the women voters as well. Point Number Two The Liberal media and Liberals in general will tell you that Donald Trump is racist because he talked about building a wall on the border of Mexico and the U.S. This is a lie perpetuated by the left to make low information voters and the over all ""dumbed-down"" Americans believe Trump is truly a racist. They don't want you to believe that a secure border has nothing to do with race and everything to do with keeping a country (in this case the United States) secure from its enemies and continue its success. Racism is defined as a hatred for another race due to their racial makeup. ""rac""ism G2;rāG6;sizəm/ noun the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races. prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior"" -Google definition of racism. This definition would indicate that Donald Trump wants to build the border wall between Mexico and the United States because he believes whites (Caucasians) are superior to Hispanics (Mexicans). This is not true. What is the duty of the United States government? What is their job? Well, according to the Constitution, set up by our founding fathers well over 200 years ago, it is to uphold the Constitution and keep the borders safe from enemies both foreign and domestic. Building a border wall would help to stop illegal activities from happening between the two countries, or at the least, slow it down significantly. This includes slowing down, if not stopping completely, the amount of illegal people from crossing. Donald Trump did not win this election because there were a lot of racist white men voting. No, on the contrary, he won from the combined effort of Conservative Americans, along with Moderate Americans, and even many Democrats who felt betrayed by a man they elected into office twice because he promised a better life and a better country.

donald trump,"Donald Trump is NOT a racist, despite what how the media portrays him. 1. He is against illegal immigration. He is pro immigration and not racist towards Hispanics. ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending they're best. They're sending people with problems and they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" That's a quote from Trump's campaign announcement, and if you only heard this part, you'd think he's anti-immigration and generally discriminatory towards Mexicans. That's not the case. Keep in mind he was discussing illegal immigration when he used that quote. ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending they're best."" There's a difference between the government 'sending' people and people immigrating. So what Trump is saying is that the Mexican government is sending not-so-nice people over the border illegally - and they are. A pamphlet published by the Mexican government itself explaining how to illegally cross the border was recently discovered - source on that below. And the thing about these illegal immigrants is that we have had at least 3 million arrests attached to them (with tens of thousands of violent assaults, rapes, and murders) - there's only estimated to be 11 million! If that's Mexico's best, I'd hate to see their worst. ""And some, I assume, are good people."" There's the part where Trump affirms that he is not referring to all illegal immigrants as bad people, thus proving he is not generalizing every illegal immigrant.

For a country that's eighteen trillion dollars in debt, I would think that would help America. People think that Trump is too straightforward. President Obama is not straightforward.

Why haven't we blown them off the face of the earth? When you're straightforward, like Trump, then you know what to do. You put troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria and end them. Another issue is illegal immigration. People like Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are helping those people. There is a reason why it's called ""illegal"". You don't accept these people, they will take up the space for many Syrian refugees coming in legally. You deport them. Finally, let's turn to the Democratic party. Already we see problems.

Regarding side proposition's points on Trump's investment in Trump International Golf Links of Scotland, the golf course is still up and running today [3]. I guess this is the quality of information you get when you get your sources from thinkprogress.com. In closing, we have seen today that Trump's business acumen, regardless of your political views, is undeniable. Side proposition today not only seems confused about the resolution but is, in fact, misinformed. Moreover, side pro seems incapable of providing a single credible source, therefore nullifying every point they have previously made. The proposition has, today, let their political bias cloud their reasoning, utterly destroying their argument and thereby ending the debate.

donald trump,"wait... i couldn't really tell what you just said. are you going to pick on donald trump like i set you up to do, or are you going to tell us what a good person he is? i don't think you can do that if you're the con. you can't ""defend him against attacks and prove that he will make america great again."" that's MY job. so just sit back, relax, and enjoy. judges, i warn you, this debate is going to illicit some serious laughter. alright, here we are, a democrat pretending to be a republican(me) and a republican forced into being a democrat(you). here's a list of why the don is really a very good guy. 1.he's not QUITE as bad as hitler. okay, i admit, the two are VERRRY similar, but old donald is a lot more adorable, don't you think? hitler has black, dark, menacing hair, he has cuddly orange. plus, donald hasn't killed any minorities(even though he may soon). 2.the donald is honest. he's the guy who lets his profanity out without thinking, you know? he lets his words flow like niagara falls. even though he does have the vocabulary of a third grader, his profanity is that of an adult. he's very honest on his opinions of minorities, of women, of the poor. at least he doesn't lie about it. he goes all in. we need an honest guy on that golden throne. 3.he's very experienced. it's wrong to say that business and economy are separate things, even though they are. business skills are really all you need to be the leader of the united states, right? you don't need military tactics or diplomatic skills or knowledge of american laws or even love in your heart. you just need to be rich. his story isn't exactly a rags to riches story. it's more like saying that you need wealth to become president, and that nobody who grew up poor will ever make a change in the world. that's a darn good message! 4. his mind control rays are so beautiful! i await your next argument. and please, don't try to say anything good about mister orange. i got that covered. you keep your own role.",PRO,"it's wrong to say that business and economy are separate things, even though they are. ... i await your next argument.",1011
donald trump,"Well, my opponent seems fair with his arguments, but he cannot answer, straight to the point, those five questions because he made a compulsive mistake. Donald Trump is the most unpopular president ever in American history, and his mandate of ""America First"" is somewhat similar to Charles Lindbergh's belief when he opposed entering the United States from the Second World War. Your assumptions on why Trump still won despite the negativity aren't classified as valid arguments. In the eyes of many, yes, he is seen as a racist, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, and a bully, but the people who Trump helped them are similar to what Muammar Qaddafi and his supporters did since his reign as the leader of Libya. His followers ""disenfranchised or disadvantaged by previous administrations"" found Trump as the only solution, but he is similar to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Trump has removed pollution controls, withdrawn from the TPP (which Trump-supporters believe is the cause of the declining domestic manufacturing sector), implemented the travel ban, and even pulled out the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. They were some of Trump's main promises which have been"" fulfilled"" in the first 6 months of Trump's time in office. To Trump's supporters, that is an ""accomplishment"", but to the silent majority, a disaster and a dereliction of American democracy. His promises are kept by word as an authoritarian, and those changes, to the delight of his supporters, led to where the United States is at right now: a third-world country, a flawed democracy, a one-party state ruled by the Republicans, a laughingstock in the eyes of the world, and a dystopia ruled by the rich and powerful who did nothing but undoing Barack Obama's legacy. If Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would have been President of the United States, or Hillary Clinton would have won the election, America would have never gone the path of eradication and complete destruction. Obama's legacy would have been solidified, and America's position as the leader of the free world and the most powerful democracy would have remained. But thanks to Donald Trump and his supporters, the United States is now dying and on the path of extinction as a country. He didn't even define the meaning of good and bad populism precisely and accurately. I challenge my opponent to answer one question: will you condemn Donald Trump's actions as President and stop the construction of the border wall between the United States and Mexico, as well as reconsidering his decision on the Paris Climate Agreement, or will he just stand here and do nothing but stating arguments that are not really valid?",PRO,"Well, my opponent seems fair with his arguments, but he cannot answer, straight to the point, those five questions because he made a compulsive mistake.  ...

donald trump,"""Donald Trump believes he is all powerful like his buddy Vladimir Putin. "" 1. If you are implying Trump loves the idea of authoritarianism and dictatorships you are actually contradicting your own argument that under Trump you would have a choice on where you die. Dictatorships tend to restrict choice and freedoms, Not increase them so even if Donald Trump had the ability to override your bodies desire to die at one place so you'd instead die at the place you wanted to die, It is unlikely he would give you that choice. If anything you would die where Donald Trump told you to die whenever you liked that place or not. You wouldn't have a choice in the matter. However even with all that said Donald Trump still cannot tell your body not drown or die of a heart attack, At a place you do not want to die. Your body will determine if you're heart will no longer beat at a certain location, And you as a person have no say on that matter. 2. ""He has told states what to do concerning covid 19. "" Doesn't telling someone what to do imply lack of choice? If Donald Trump was giving people a choice on where they die, Wouldn't he not give any orders at all and simply let people and states work out that matter for themselves? This is all of course under the hypothetical scenario of people gaining the ability to choose where they die in the first place. We still can't choose where we will die in the end, So either way this fails to show Donald Trump has given a person the ability to choose where they want to die. 3. ""He has told companies that they cannot produce products in china. "" What does a companies ability to produce products in china have to do with a person having the ability to choose where they die? 4. ""He has told California that they cannot have higher environmental standards then the US government. "" What does dictating environmental standards have to do with determining if trump has given people the ability to choose where they die? I see no connection. ""Donald Trump believes he is the supreme leader. "" 5. So what? Even if he does believe he is the supreme leader that doesn't make it true. I can believe I am a unicorn from the planet pizza land but that doesn't change the fact I am still a human on earth. And even if he was the supreme leader, That alone fails to prove he has given humans the ability to choose where they die.",CON,"Dictatorships tend to restrict choice and freedoms, Not increase them so even if Donald Trump had the ability to override your bodies desire to die at one place so you'd instead die at the place you wanted to die, It is",1013
donald trump,"There were some non RINO republicans that said he is a racist.

donald trump,"1: This is a quote from the source of your claim- ""In fairness, Those suits date from long ago[1970], And the discriminatory policies were probably put in place not by Donald Trump but by his father. Fred Trump appears to have been arrested at a Ku Klux Klan rally in 1927; Woody Guthrie, Who lived in a Trump property in the 1950s, Lambasted Fred Trump in recently discovered papers for stirring racial hatred. "" 2: This is an unverified claim by someone who says they heard trump say that. He denied the comment, So who knows if its true. 3: Donald denied this comment and other people in the meeting said they do not recall it. He said in a tweet he thinks it is a poor and troubled country, Which does not have to do with race, But the conditions of the country and the conditions of people in the country. Quote from cited article- ""That is why Trump invoked Norwegians as ""good"" immigrants Thursday, In contrast to the Haitians and Africans.
