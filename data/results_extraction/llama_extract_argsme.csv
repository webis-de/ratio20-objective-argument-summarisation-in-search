0	Climate change clearly does not exist. This is due to the fact that exhaling carbon dioxide is not a clear threat to our climate, since we breathe it out and our cars do it too.
1	There is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change, which has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. Man-made climate change has already claimed over 150,000 lives annually, according to estimates by the World Health Organisation, due to its effects on the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events.
2	Global warming is a proven fact and anyone that disagrees with me is ignorant on this subject. 97% of scientists believe that climate change is primarily human caused.
3	Climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind, and the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as the Zika virus is among the threats we face due to it. Additionally, there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is being caused by human activity.
4	Climate change is real and anthropogenic, with the majority of scientists in agreement. Denying this is a fraud, as it involves not just accepting the majority of scientists are wrong, but also that they are intentionally lying.
5	The climate is not changing. The local weather may change but the global climate stays basically the same.
6	Climate change is a real phenomenon caused by human industrial activity that has been correlated with a marked rise in temperature. This has been supported by scientific evidence such as increased atmospheric COS22; levels and a 1"C rise in global temperatures since 1969.
7	Climate change is a fraud and those who support it are all frauds and charlatans. The science behind human-caused climate change is full of misconceptions and bad science.
8	Climate change is widely discussed these days, with many people debating whether or not human activities are the cause. While some claim that human actions are having a significant impact on the global climate, others maintain that natural forces are the primary cause of any climate change that is occurring.
9	Climate change is an ongoing political debate, but there is a 97% consensus among experts that humans are extremely likely to be the cause of recent global events. Co2
10	Feminism is a movement that seeks to promote the rights and liberation of women. There are many different forms of feminism, such as Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism.
11	Feminism is the advocacy of equal rights and opportunities for women, regardless of gender. It is not associated with negative attributes, nor should it be limited to one gender.
12	Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women, and Con has failed to provide any proof that words with similar roots can't have different meanings. Con has argued that dictionaries don't authoritatively define words, but has not provided any evidence for this claim.
13	Feminism is the advocacy for social, political, and economic equality for women. Feminists strive to create a world where men and women are equal and are treated with respect and dignity.
14	Feminism is an important movement that seeks to bring about equality between the sexes, and is still needed in many parts of the world. Though success has been found in some first-world countries, inequality still exists and feminism will still be important to maintain that equality and help spread the ideology to other parts of the world where help is needed.
15	Feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but the conditions of the countries' economy and social interaction must be taken into account. Slow, progressive changes should be made to address each conflict differently before feminism is introduced.
16	Feminism was originally created to promote the equal rights of men and women, but modern feminism has become an ideology focused on avenging the historical wrongs done to women. However, blaming men for the actions of previous generations is unproductive and will only further alienate the sexes.
17	Feminism is a movement which advocates for the rights and equality of women. Egalitarianism is the belief that all people should be treated equally regardless of gender.
18	Feminism is defined as "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men". Pro conceded that feminism is good, as well as not denying that feminism is bad by not attacking my advantages of feminism.
19	Feminism today is twisted and hypocritical, so it is best to abandon it and strive for equalism for both men and women.
20	Abortion should be illegal because it isn't safe, laws are intended to protect unborn babies, and fetuses can feel pain.
21	Abortion has been a highly debated topic for centuries and there are two opposing sides to the argument. Those who are in favor of abortion believe that a woman should have the right to choose whether or not she wants to continue with the pregnancy while those against it believe that abortion should be illegal as it constitutes the termination of a potential life.   
22	Abortion is either done intentionally or spontaneously, and can be induced by humans or take place spontaneously. Induced abortions can be therapeutic or elective, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.
23	Abortion is a controversial issue and both sides present valid arguments. Some believe that abortion should be legal, as it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body, while others think that abortion should be illegal as it is the taking of an innocent life.
24	Abortion is a highly controversial topic, with many people holding strong opinions either for or against it. Those in favor of abortion usually argue that it is a woman's right to choose and should be legal, while those against it argue that it is the killing of an unborn child and should be illegal.
25	Abortion is necessary to control population growth and prevent it from getting out of hand. If we don't allow abortion, population growth will be accelerated by force and women will be subjected to abortion later in life, leading to an increase in the suicide rate.
26	The statement "Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate" implies that whether abortion is considered assault is not relevant to the debate. However, this is not true, as the topic of abortion being immoral or wrong is an important part
27	Abortion should be allowed because the costs associated with unintended pregnancy and childbearing can be extremely high, and forcing mothers to have children they do not want can lead to negative outcomes for both mother and child. Additionally, the financial burden of raising a child until they are 18 averages around 250K
28	Women's lives, Health, and basic human rights depend on the availability of abortion, and making it illegal will only increase maternal mortality.
29	Abortion is a highly controversial topic, with many different perspectives and opinions. Those in favour of abortion argue that it should be legal and that it is the womanâ€™s right to choose.
30	Trump is not life, as it does not meet any of the requirements for life: maintaining balanced conditions, being highly organized, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, or reproduction.
31	Trump's racist rhetoric is divisive and destructive and will cause harm to the US by destroying communities, inciting hatred and mistrust, and increasing crime.
32	Trump's plan to build a wall, fight ISIS, and strengthen the Christian religion will make him the greatest president of all time, according to his supporters. He claims that his plan will bring back jobs from China, Japan, Mexico and other places, as well as bring back American money.
33	Trump is an inconsiderate jerk who thinks he can say whatever he wants without consequence, and his policies won't reduce our debt or make it ok to build a wall and ignore Mexico's input on the matter.
34	Trump's stance on immigration could lead to the emergence of racist organizations that perpetuate violence and kill innocent people, so voting for him is not advisable.
35	Donald Trump has shifted his opinions on policy and made contributions to both Bill and Hillary Clinton in the past, but this does not necessarily indicate that he is secretly plotting to get them elected. Furthermore, he has not violated any biblical teachings by claiming not to ask for forgiveness from God.
36	Donald Trump is arguing that he is best positioned to fight ISIS because of his tough negotiating skills and his lack of political correctness. He also claims that ISIS has become wealthy from terrorism, and they are now a direct competitor of Trump Hotels.
37	Trump should not be the president of the world because he does not have the necessary qualifications nor does he have the support of the majority of voters. A card trump may win over a card that is not of the same suit, but a president must be elected or appointed by the people to preside over an organized body of people.
38	Trump is just another one of the everyone that lie. His lack of complete honesty is in line with the mainstream of US politicians and media outlets nowadays.
39	Donald Trump is a serial liar who has trouble with the truth and whose statements are often rated as "mostly false," "false," or "pants on fire" by Politifact.
40	Brexit will be beneficial because the UK will have more control over their own laws and regulations, and will be able to make decisions that are in their own best interests. Also, it could open up new opportunities for economic growth and increased trade.
41	Brexit would not have been economically beneficial for the UK, and would likely have caused a long-term negative impact on the economy. Additionally, Britain would have had no control over its immigration policy if it had left the EU, and would have likely seen negative effects from limiting immigration.
42	Brexit will be beneficial for England as it will allow them to control their own borders, regulate immigration from the Middle East, save them money from not having to pay EU fees, and give them the freedom to make their own laws and regulations without the interference of the European Union.
43	Brexit is an issue of national security and economic freedom. The migrant crisis in Europe is proof that having open borders is a recipe for disaster, allowing terrorists, criminals, and refugees to easily cross borders unchecked.
44	Britain has benefitted from its historical ties with Europe and has prospered from it. Britain's economy has grown stronger as it has remained integrated with Europe and its free trade policies.
45	The UK's exit from the EU could create uncertainty for Indian businesses and lead to decreased investment and movement of professionals to the UK. Additionally, the volatility of the pound could increase the risk for businesses in India.
46	England is facing problems with migration and unemployment due to its relationship with the European Union, which diminishes the quality of life for its citizens. To remedy this, the UK must separate from the EU in order to give its people more opportunities for work, education, and healthcare.
47	Leaving the EU will allow Britain to take back control of its borders and regain the ability to decide which immigrants to admit and under what circumstances. It will also give Britain the freedom to decide which laws to adopt and create an immigration system that works in Britain's interests.
48	The UK is embarking on a historical journey by pursuing independence, which is difficult to come by and will require hard work. The evidence provided by the pro-brexit side is reliable, and the WTO and EU constitution have been provided as sources.
49	Death penalty cases are more expensive than non-death penalty cases due to the cost of housing prisoners in solitary confinement for the rest of their lives, as well as the cost of appeals. It is also possible that innocent people could be executed, which would violate the Eighth Amendment.
50	The death penalty is an expensive form of punishment that has been shown to have the potential to wrongly convict innocent people and can lead to the execution of innocent people. It costs more than life in prison without parole to carry out a death sentence and has been proven to be more expensive over time than life in prison without parole.
51	The death penalty is an effective deterrent for crime and has been proven to reduce crime rates in certain states. It is also cost efficient and morally justified.
52	Death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes and decreases crime overall. Additionally, it avenges innocent lives, decreases jail overpopulation, and puts fear into other criminals.
53	The death penalty is a deterrent, decreases prisoner population, prevents criminals from re-offending and is a good form of retribution.
54	The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars because it costs more to execute an individual than to keep them in prison for life, and there's no guarantee that the death penalty will deter crime since innocent people are sometimes executed. Furthermore, the death penalty is applied in an unfair manner and is used too rarely to have a strong deterrent effect.
55	The death penalty is immoral because it involves taking away an individual's life for an offense and there is a risk of wrongful convictions that could lead to an innocent person being killed.
56	The death penalty is more expensive than imprisonment for life due to the cost of repeated appeals, additional court costs, and higher defense costs. It also puts innocent people at risk of being executed, as has happened in the past.
57	The death penalty is necessary to provide justice to the victims and their families and to deter crime. The majority of people support it, and its implementation is effective in creating a sense of justice and stability in society.
58	The death penalty should not be used as it is inhumane, expensive and not an effective deterrent for murder. Life imprisonment is a more humane and cost effective way of punishing criminals, as it allows for rehabilitation and forgiveness while focus on the victimsâ€™ families.
59	Google is releasing products such as Google Classroom and Cars which, if used by everyone, would put all documents on the internet, making paper extinct. With the ability to control all education and transport, Google would be able to control the
60	Google has been around for longer and gets more visitors than Bing, but Bing is catching up. While a majority of people prefer Google, 33% of Google users said they would be using Bing more often after taking part in tests.
61	Google is a reliable source, and true so pro must win. Con argued that Google is not a reliable source, but this is an argument; Con has no evidence.
62	Google has many safety flaws, such as plagiarism and phishing, and is becoming increasingly unsafe for users due to its inability to properly protect personal information. Furthermore, Google Traffic View has been shown to lead to increased traffic and road accidents, making it an unsafe tool for drivers
63	Bing is not being given its due credit as a search engine. This is due to the bias of people who prefer Google and the lack of experience with Bing among its detractors.
64	Google does not block results for "authorities on subjects" as long as the search query includes the relevant subject, which indicates that the argument on the right is invalid. Moreover, the issue is not that Google is a truth-selling authority but that it challenges existing authorities such as The Economist on economics, which again invalidates the argument.
65	Google is the clear winner in the ongoing newspaper battle, as it has the financial backing and resources to obtain high ranking results slots or to protect copyright/patents. Established authorities in various subject areas may not be as concerned with being accessible to gullible children as they are with defending their turf.
66	Google Glass presents an opportunity to rethink how people learn and how tests are administered. It is up to educators to adapt to this new technology and find ways for students to learn effectively with it.
67	Google's Review Rating System is bad because it cannot guarantee safety, And good and bad are the measurement of success and the achievement of 100% is the criteria. Therefore, The Google Review System is bad.
68	Google+ should stay integrated with YouTube, as it has caused no harm to users, and has beneficial features such as infinite characters for commenting, and a free account that requires no harm to fill out. Additionally, there has been no evidence presented to suggest that Google+ has caused any of the problems listed by the opposition.
69	Ethical vegans reject animal use and consumption of all animal-based products, while dietary vegans consume no animal food or dairy products. Veganism is a philosophy that extends beyond dietary choices and promotes the abolishment of animal use.
70	Veganism is a philosophy that rejects the commodification of animals and abstains from animal products in diet. Oral sex and swallowing semen is ethically acceptable within veganism, as it does not reduce the sender to a piece of meat.
71	A vegan diet is more efficient than an omnivorous diet in terms of acreage, factory farming is cruel, and a vegan diet takes less acreage. Additionally, a vegan diet helps to reduce world hunger, is better for animal happiness, and is better for the environment.
72	Veganism goes against the natural order and could result in the slaughter of animals, as it is not practical for humans to stop eating something that has been part of our diet since the beginning of the human race. Humans are not the only ones who kill living beings, and forcing everyone to go vegan could
73	Hippopotamuses are vegetarian, but are vegan posers as they eat dairy and eggs but are not truly vegan. They are related to other two-toed animals like camels, cows, deer, and pigs, all of whom are vegetarian but not vegan.
74	Vegans are typically viewed as more compassionate and environmentally conscious than meat-eaters, but this argument suggests that vegans may in fact be no more selfless or concerned than meat-eaters. The argument also claims that humans are selfish and careless with regards to the environment regardless of their dietary choices, meaning that vegans may not be any better than meat-eaters in terms of their environmental impact.
75	Veganism is an ethical lifestyle choice that aims to reduce animal suffering, decrease environmental harm, and promote human health. Many animal rights activists view veganism as the ultimate ethical lifestyle choice as it minimizes the impact of human activity on animal lives.
76	Vegan women who swallow their partners' semen are hypocrites, as sperm is produced by humans and is an animal product. However, most women these days aren't so prudish and are quite happy to quaff their boyfriends' penile coloda.
77	Vegan women who swallow their boyfriend's semen are hypocrites because they are breaking their vow to not consume animal products, even though the boyfriend's semen is high in protein.
78	Vegetables are a source of essential nutrients that are lacking in meat, including B12, chicken, beef, and cheese. Most animals are in fact vegans, and vegetables provide the vitamins and minerals that meat-eating animals require
79	Nuclear energy has many benefits, such as providing economical advantages due to its low cost of production, as well as offering the potential to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of global warming. Despite its hazards, such as creating radioactive wastes and posing risks to human health, the
80	Nuclear energy offers many benefits, but it also has significant risks that make it unfeasible for much of the world. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are more cost effective and environmentally friendly alternatives.
81	Nuclear power creates jobs, is cost effective, and has solutions for its nuclear waste issues. It is a reliable source of energy that has many benefits for the economy.
82	Nuclear energy has some advantages, such as efficiency, low carbon emissions and the potential for long-term savings in energy costs. However, it has some drawbacks, such as the potential for nuclear waste to be hazardous for thousands of years, and the potential for nuclear accidents to have catastrophic outcomes.
83	Nuclear energy has numerous risks associated with it, including waste, cost, dependency, and accidents. Waste production is a major issue as the UK produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste per year, which is both expensive and dangerous.
84	Nuclear energy is a reliable and cost-effective source of energy, as evidenced by its large usage in many countries around the world. The risks associated with the production of nuclear energy are minimal when compared to the benefits it provides, as evidenced by the low rate of deaths among workers in nuclear power plants.
85	Nuclear energy does not pose an added threat to national security and is not as expensive as claimed. Other countries have been successful in managing risks associated with nuclear energy and the USA already has hundreds of nuclear weapons which do not get used anyway.
86	Nuclear energy is not the way forward for the United States, as every point of my opponent's argument has been refuted. Solar technology has been proven for years and is not as unsafe as my opponent claims.
87	Nuclear energy currently creates 20% of the world's energy, but it can only increase to 20% due to the increasing demand. Additionally, the radioactive waste and early stage cooling system issues mean that it cannot be a significant part of the energy pie.
88	Nuclear energy is a promising source of energy that is efficient, sustainable and relatively cheap to produce, but it needs to be regulated and monitored carefully. Other sources of energy such as solar, wind and hydro are renewable, sustainable and clean.
89	Donald Trump is a businessman who is appealing to conservative Republicans and Independents by promising to promote their beliefs if elected President. Whether or not he is sincere remains to be seen.
90	Donald Trump is a successful businessman, but he also has some unstable qualities that could lead to disaster if he loses his touch. His declarations in the last debate, for example, indicate a lack of
91	Donald Trump is a bad candidate because he has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and refuses to explain his policies in detail. He has said offensive things about Mexicans and women, and is a danger to global relations with his threats to tax China and make them pay for a wall.
92	Donald Trump is lacking in political experience, is racist and sexist, and has not provided any clear plans on how he would replace Obamacare. He has also made derogatory comments about Mexicans, women, and others.
93	Donald Trump is attempting to achieve great power through the Sith organization, which wishes to overthrow the weak and rule with absolute unobstructed power. He is also critically attacking weaker opponents like Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry in order to build support for himself, while also displaying a strong hatred for Mexican immigrants and wearing Sith garments and commanding a legion of soldiers.
94	Donald Trump is a racist liar who teases Native Americans, thinks white supremacists are heroes, and might want to kill the current President of the United States. Voting for him is a terrible idea and can lead to a dangerously divisive and xenophobic America.
95	Donald Jackleberry Trump is not my president because he is an imaginary character that bears a striking resemblance to Donald J. Trump, but is nonetheless not the actual President of the United States. Even if I had specified which Trump I was referring to, it does not change the fact that he is an imaginary character, and thus not my president.
96	Donald Trump may be a successful businessman, but he lacks the necessary qualities to be an effective President. He fails to demonstrate empathy and humanity, and his policies have caused unrest among the US population.
97	Donald Trump is a serial liar who has trouble with the truth and whose statements are often rated as false or "pants on fire" by Politifact.
98	Donald Trump is the only president who is telling the truth and is trying to make a difference, but no one is listening. The Democrats have been causing poverty for the rest of the world by creating the virus, and Robert de Niro's comments show he is just as evil as Trump claims.
