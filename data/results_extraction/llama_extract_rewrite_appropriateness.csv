It is analogous to smoking and drugs, and its prevalence in developed countries is probably due to an aging population.
1	My sister's husband earns a substantial salary, yet they still qualify for various benefits such as W.I.C, Daycare Assistance, and food benefits. It pays to look into these services, as even high-earning couples may be able to access financial aid.
2	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit.

4	Gun control is largely ineffective, as criminals will still find ways to acquire weapons, while law-abiding citizens may be prevented from doing so. This leaves law-abiding citizens vulnerable to criminal attacks, while doing nothing to reduce crime.
5	Sin is taught to be wrong in religion, and as a result, young men may have a distorted view of what is right and wrong, leading to acts such as rape. The connection between religion and rape is not to be ignored, and we should focus on teaching morals rather than religion to make sure young people understand right and wrong.
6	Lesbians are often seen as more attractive than gay men in a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men. Additionally, lesbians face less discrimination than gay men because they are perceived as not challenging gender roles.
7	America chooses to ignore the oppressive policies of the Chinese government due to its concern for preserving good economic relations, even though a lot of the cheap labor outsourced there is done by slaves. We really should start to see the truth and take action to address this injustice.

10	Scott Peterson was the white contrast to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman."
11	Hamas's indiscriminate firing of 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks has left Israel with no choice but to retaliate. With the main goal of Hamas being the destruction of Israel, Israel has the right to neutralize the organization in order to ensure the safety of its citizens.

15	Given that the death penalty is used primarily as a form of retaliation, televised executions could potentially be an effective form of disseminating information to the public about the death penalty and its consequences in the United States. This could potentially change people's beliefs and attitudes towards the death penalty.
16	Western democracy is not the answer for conflict countries, as Islam lacks the Enlightenment background necessary to form such a government. Additionally, Islam demands that church and state be unified, making it difficult to establish a secular constitutional republic.
17	Some laws can be seen as morally wrong and thus, it may be justified to break these laws if the penalty is not severe and it does not invade upon the realms of human rights and religious beliefs. For example, speeding or not wearing a seat belt, while it may be seen as
18	The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets, making her difficult to defeat. In comparison, Optimus Prime has many weapons but is not powerful enough to defeat the Hulk.
19	It is unreasonable to expect men to put the toilet seat down after urinating because the expectation is not reciprocated, it cancels out and puts an extra burden on the next user, and it goes against basic etiquette of using a shared toilet.
20	The Government of Maharashtra recently put a ban on ladies bars in order to stop criminal activities and complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money and not taking care of their families. Cases such as Tarannum's monthly income of Rs. 1 lakh and Telgi throwing away around Rs. 1 lakh daily on bar girls were some of the reasons why the ban was implemented
21	Gay marriage should not be accepted or encouraged as it would go against the traditional definition of marriage, which has always been between a man and a woman. Moreover, rewarding same-sex couples with tax breaks would not be beneficial for society, as it could lead to increased acceptance of
22	The storm-cloaks may be painted as the villains of the civil war in Skyrim, but they do have some redeeming qualities. Firstly, they are not racist, as their treatment of other races is no worse than that of the Empire.
23	India has the potential to lead the world with the remarkable scientists produced by institutions such as IIT, and NASA is a prime example of this. We must, however, create a better environment for these talented individuals by providing suitable job opportunities, developing industry and increasing salaries to retain them in India.
24	Porn rarely leads to addiction and is mostly limited to those with weak resolve or mental health issues. It can be used to spice up sex life but should not be relied upon exclusively.
25	Insurance companies consider many factors when setting rates, including the gender and driving history of the driver.

27	Reservation was introduced in India with the intention of helping those from underprivileged backgrounds, however, the benefits of it have been monopolized by a few people from these societies who are already from well-off backgrounds, whilst the genuinely needy are still struggling. This has caused outrage since it is unfair for those who truly need the aid to be denied it, while those who do not need it are the ones receiving it.
28	Russian people typically dislike foreigners who are seen as a threat to their country or who are viewed as causing harm to their culture and society. Some countries are more popular than others among Russian people, so it is not an overall blanket hatred.
29	Freedom of speech should not be restricted, as this would go against the very idea of freedom of speech, which is intrinsically linked to personal responsibility and accountability. Though the Islamic world is overreacting, their reaction cannot be discounted as it is a valid response to the

31	We should focus on solving our own planet's problems before considering space exploration. Our world faces immense issues such as poverty, population growth, pollution, and global warming, so it's crucial to fix these first before moving on to other planets.
32	It should be the owner of the property's choice whether to allow smoking or not, not the government's. Most places in Ohio are non-smoking anyway
33	The "Culture of Life" republicans are not protesting this abuse of power because it does not fit into their political agenda of protecting the lives of only certain types of people. They are instead happy to allow this poor woman to die without the public controversy that surrounded the Schiavo case.
34	The US has one of the strongest navies in the world and 366 military ships in commission, yet only 4 ships are stationed in the area which is prone to pirate attacks. This vast expanse of sea requires a greater presence of ships to protect the trade routes
35	Banning teenage sexuality altogether is not a realistic or sensible solution, as it goes against people's freedom to make their own decisions and can result in negative consequences such as overcrowded j
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils, so why not annex a portion of Germany and relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, allowing for the acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land?
37	Massachusetts melanie's law? Should be scrutinized carefully to ensure that it does not infringe on the rights of citizens unreasonably, and that its provisions are based on rational considerations rather than emotion.
38	Both Christianity and atheism are based on beliefs, but Christianity is supported by faith in God while atheism is based on the lack of belief in a higher power.

47	The founding fathers envisioned a society where taxation is done in order to provide for the common good and to ensure the protection of people’s rights. They were opposed to taxation without representation, not taxation in general.

49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people that 9/11 was an inside job. However, there are some who refuse to believe it due to their faith in the government.
50	Installation art that borrows from Duchamp's Fountain, such as asking the question "what is art", has become overly commonplace, resulting in tedium and apathy.

53	In California, fathers have the right to legally fight for their children's contact if the mother won't allow it, unless they are found unfit for some reason. It is essential that fathers take action and fight for their rights.
54	The majority of poor Americans are content with their situation, preferring to not have to work or go to college, or to put in the effort required to move up in society. Many are hindered by mental or physical health issues, or have had a bad start in life, which makes it more difficult to pursue a better life.
55	I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, but I don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times and I believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility.
56	Humans are artificial beings created by God, our creator. If we are capable of creating a sentient lifeform, then it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, unless it achieves the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms.

59	The US is home to around 1/20th of the world's population but 1/3 of its prison population. This is largely due to the nation's "war on crime" and "war on drugs" policies enacted in the late 1970s and early 80s under President Reagan.
60	It is reasonable to let criminals vote while they are incarcerated, as long as they are not felons. Some criminals have the potential to reform and become upstanding citizens, and should be given the chance to vote after a suitable amount of time.

63	Pro choice and pro life arguments should be put aside, as whatever way a fetus is viewed it is still a living form that has been created in an intimate manner. It is not the child's fault for being created in such a manner, and giving the child up for adoption is the compassionate choice in such cases.
64	Despite the fact that catch and release fishing can be seen as immoral due to the suffering of the fish caught, many fishers argue that it can be morally justified.

67	People often post comments on Reddit consisting solely of pop culture references without having any meaningful thoughts to contribute. This is a sign of a vacuous infant lacking in original ideas and unable to express themselves in any meaningful way.
68	The U.S. views China as a lucrative partner due to its large consumer market and low-cost products, while they turn a blind eye to the country's anti-democratic policies and interference in Central Asia.

69	Upon reaching the age of 18, an individual is considered an adult and is expected to be self-supporting.

70	I understand the democratic party collects the most money from PACs, yet unions only supply a comparatively tiny amount. Corporations, on the other hand, are able to exert undue influence and provide a huge amount of funding to politicians.
71	Farquhar was not simply a "discoverer" of Singapore but a prominent figure in its establishment. He was Raffles' assistant so he had to consult Raffles and take his authority into consideration, which is why Raffles gets most of the credit.
72	People are not pedophiles, but they are still lazy, fat asses who spend all their time posing as teenagers on the internet.

74	People should have the right to explore their own consciousness without fear of prosecution as long as they do not harm anyone else in the process. Regulations similar to those concerning alcohol should be implemented, such as prohibiting their use in public.

76	The United States' freedom was obtained by standing up for what is right and fighting against tyranny. Unfortunately, many people have forgotten this and have been swayed by the terrorists' destructive agenda.
77	It is likely that without universal soldiers and bomb makers, there would be less warfare and more peace. There would be calm and not so calm areas of the world, with little communes and gang rivaled cities.
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice that should be respected, just as straight marriage is a choice that is respected. Love is all some people have, and it's not right to take
79	It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you can use the lousy father as an excuse for your mistakes and not have to worry about him prying into your affairs or taking your things. He will also not demonstrate a loving fatherly care, so you will not have to worry about that either.

81	Allowing performance enhancing drugs in professional sports would lead to an increase in their use among both professional and amateur athletes. This could have detrimental health effects on the athletes, as well as send the wrong message to younger athletes who might be encouraged to use them due to the presence of their role models.
82	Nancy Pelosi cannot remove an elected official from office unless they have actually done something illegal, usually at the felony level. The appearance of impropriety may be enough to remove a judge, but that is not the case for elected officials.
83	It's not just that some judges can be bought; the bigger issue is that political and ideological views are influencing some judges' decisions in the courtroom. This raises the risk of unequal justice, as some judges are more likely to listen to cases based on their own beliefs rather than the law.
84	Margaret Thatcher was incredibly unpopular in Britain during her time as Prime Minister, due to her policies that caused decay in old industries, poverty, and the death of Bobby Sands and others. Despite this, some people still see her as a great leader.

86	If you aren't the dad but the mom, you could give extra money to help support the child. Alternatively, you can request a review of the child support payments through the court, which can take some time to complete but will re-evaluate the amount due per month.
87	India has the potential to become a global leader, but it is not yet fully developed and may not succeed in its efforts. Other countries, such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan, are more progressive and powerful in terms of technology and ability to meet the needs of their people.
88	The minimum wage is the minimum that an employer is required to pay, but it does not necessarily represent the employer's expectation of the effort put forth by the employee. In jobs that require skill or intellect, it is unfair to expect employees to give 110% when the employer is only willing to pay for 100%.
89	I believe that if a person is strong enough to consider or even attempt suicide, then they are also strong enough to choose to continue living. It doesn't make sense to give up on life when you have the capability of taking it.
90	The gun control laws in the United States are inconsistent across different states, creating a complicated system for individuals who want to purchase a firearm. While there are certain universal background checks and safety protocols that must be met prior to gun purchase, the process can vary greatly from state to state.
91	The phrase "be a man" implies that traditional gender roles are the norm, and reinforces the idea that men are the leaders and protectors of society. Furthermore, it implies that these values are exclusive to men and women cannot have them, or if they do have them, they must act "like a lady".
92	In the UK, healthy food is often much cheaper than people think. Grocery stores offer bags of carrots, celery, oats and bananas for relatively low prices, and purchasing large quantities of chicken breast for freezing can prove to be an economical option.
93	Yahoo! Answers appears to be politically and/or racially biased, as it allows some questionable content to go unchecked while arbitrarily enforcing its policies on users with differing political views.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. Those who have it have the potential to hyper focus and grasp more knowledge when they do focus.
95	Hypocrites?   It is nearly impossible to think through every issue for oneself due to the sheer number of them.
96	My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything.
97	Given the frequency of repeats and lack of seriousness on this website, I believe that political debates should no longer be desired, and that the guidelines for debate topics should be proclaimed to members. Otherwise, the website will not be taken seriously and be reduced to
98	Saddam Hussein's guilt or innocence is yet to be decided, but whatever the outcome, his death sentence will not be easily enforced. His supporters in Iraq still revere him, and he has displayed defiance towards the tribunal by openly declaring himself the ruler of Iraq.
99	Cuba's political stance has failed to bring about any meaningful change in the last 48 years, therefore it is time to move on and allow normal relations, trade and travel with Cuba. A new policy should be established which would open Cuban society to US business and increase tourism, making contact between the two countries beneficial.
