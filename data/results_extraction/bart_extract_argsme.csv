climate change,There is an overwhelming scientific consensus climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers. But they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe. There is also overwhelming scientific consensus climate change is being caused by human activity. There are a limited number of circumstances under which free speech can be restricted. One of them is child pornography. The reason that can be banned with violating the 1st Amendment is the harm caused to children in the production of child porn is of such magnitude the normal means of combating bad speech-- more speech is not adequate or sufficient. The ignorance peddled by climate change deniers many of whom like child pornographers do so for greed. Those threatened most by the adverse effects of climate change are children. These will include teenagers sent to fight the increasing number of wars and conflicts which will likely occur. Yes the risk is too high to allow this ignorance to continue to be peddled.

climate change,"I'll accept this challenge. First, I should ask to be clear: When you say ""climate change is a fraud, "" are you referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change or all climate change? If it is the former, As I suspect it is, I won't waste time explaining all the evidence that the globe is, In fact, Warming at an unprecedented rate and instead go straight into attribution. If, However, You don't think the globe is really warming at an unprecedented rate, I'm happy to go into the evidence for it. Moreover, ""fraud"" implies more than just the majority of scientists being wrong (i. E. Misinterpreting the evidence) but also that they are intentionally lying.

climate change,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax.

climate change,"This is as close as the opponent comes to making an argument about cause: ""A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. ' But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.'[0]"" That is the only statement that is close to an argument about cause. Then the source basically states, science does not know, but what if. Then appeals to emotion by asking people to think about their grandchildren, thus action to reduce CO2 must be taken, you know just in case. The question could also be asked, what if the consensus is wrong? The alarmists are advocating for billions of people to reduce their living standards to keep the planet from maybe warming a few degrees. Looking at the analogy mostly used to explain green house effect, which is a green house. A few years ago I was in an empty plastic sheet green house on a sunny but very cold day. The very thin sheet of clear plastic raised the inside temperature significantly, but the owner was planning on disassembling within a few days. My question to the owner was ""would a second sheet of plastic make the green house warmer for longer?"" The owner looked at me and said ""it does not work that way"". There would be an insulation effect if there is a gap between the two sheets of plastic. Yet, this false consensus is asking us to believe that more CO2 equals higher global temperatures. From an idea that more plastic does not make a green house warmer to a question would more CO2 make the Earth warmer. There is research that suggests once there is enough CO2 to have a green house effect more will not cause higher temperatures[1]. This is outside the narrative and must be stopped. Government's need a reason for people to be scared so that controls can be forced on everyone. In summary, consensus is not science! Climate change has become like a religion for those that believe. Western civilization learned centuries ago that state and religion is best separated.

feminism,"Yes certainly. But friend, simply giving your opinion on a topic isn't how you start or maintain a debate.

feminism,"Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. First off, I reject your definition of feminism.

feminism,"it seems my opponent escaped his first opportunity to start his argument, So i'll do it instead. Many people mistake feminism with misandry, However it isn't equal. My side is pro-feminism, Not pro-misandry. The definition is clear: FEMINISM:""the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes. "" MISANDRY:""dislike of, Contempt for, Or ingrained prejudice against men (i. E. The male sex). "" both groups of people may protest, But overall feminism still play the sane part. They just ask for equality and rights. Equality not absolute oligarchy. The things feminism may protest would be like: ""STOP Gender Pay Gap! "" ""Girls Can Do This! "" these types of people protests in an assertive way. They just ask for the line being pushed back to the center, Not all the way to the other side. They protest on a basis of women being less rightful, And they most likely won't make up a random scenario that women is already superior at such fields. on the other side, What we most likely to see, And what would be in the spotlight, And what whom wanted the spotlight on themselves, Are the misandrists. They are less sane and more aggressive. Being mistaken for feminists, They actually push the fault onto the true feminists. such topics misandrists would argue are: ""Men are stupid"" ""Girls should rule"" all these leads to superiority and sexism, Not anything ""sane"". Notable feminists: (not necessarily, But they contribute to the women) Marie Curie(scientist):first woman to win a Nobel Prize, The first person and only woman to win twice, And the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences.

feminism,"First to answer the attack on Observation One: Pro's response to this was that we are not in Iraq. This piece of evidence was from 2010, and since then nothing has changed as we still have people supporting feminism. During the Iraq war, it was true that they were more likely to be raped than shot. If we were in Iraq today it would still stand. Next he said he was never talking about pornography, however it can be inferred from his opener. Now the big argument he made in this last round was that all my arguments were about equal rights, not feminism. However, this argument is flawed. A quick google search indicates the definition of feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men."" This meas that feminism, by its very definition means equal rights to women. Pro admitted they are pro equal rights, so therefore, by the very definition of feminism, they are pro feminism.

It started as a civil rights movement in the 20s when women gained the right to vote. It has since pushed for women's rights which is fine.

abortion,"Thank you to both the audience and my opponent for yet another debate on abortion. The resolution is simply ""Abortion"" and my opponent has stated that he supports the affirmative. I shall then argue against that case. To begin, I submit the definition of Abortion by Medicine.net Medical Dictionary: Abortion: In medicine, an abortion is the premature exit of the products of conception (the fetus, fetal membranes, and placenta) from the uterus. It is the loss of a pregnancy and does not refer to why that pregnancy was lost. http://www.medterms.com... In addition, here is the wikipedia article in which the introduction defines abortion in the same manner: http://en.wikipedia.org... Since my opponent has used his first round to merely ask for my opening statement and did not clarify the resolution or offer any sort of framing, I will assume that my opponent is trying to affirm ""abortion"" in general. I start by arguing that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds. 1. Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries. Though this is a form of abortion, I argue that it should in no way be supported. 4. Dangerous abortions I am against many forms of abortion for health reasons. The use of coat hangers to stimulate an abortion, for example. Or throwing oneself off a flight of stairs. Or going to a back-alley abortionist that doubles as a tattoo parlor. These are all very dangerous ways of abortion. I look forward to my opponent's rebuttal. Thank you.",CON,"I shall then argue against that case. ...

(...) Mile by mile, walls and barbed wire have cut off Mexico from the United States, forcing more and more immigrants to cross over in the dangerous desolate stretches of border in Arizona. It has created an intense conflict zone, as desperate immigrant workers try to cross and survive, and an intensified government crackdown hunts them through the dry hills to trap them, capture them, (...) this reactionary Minuteman movement has emerged to demand even more extreme and violent actions against the immigrants. They have criticized the proposals made by President Bush and Mexico's President Vicente Fox to create a legal program for bringing Mexican immigrants into the U.S. So these Minutemen kill and hunt down not only illegal immigrants, but also innocent Americans.

brexit,"Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to work the dirty jobs such as farming so migrants need to do it for them. [1] Let's Look at the facts. Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 Billion pounds or 0.3% of britains GDP. So for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%. But considering the UK makes 13% of it's GDP from selling commodties to the EU this seems unlikely. [2] The problem with this is that economists predict that the UK could lose up to 6% of It's GDP from leaving the EU which is much greatet than 0.3% [3] This isn't even including additional costs for tarrifs that would amount to close of the cost for eu membership after free trade deals are abolished along with eu membership. [4] Also, Britain has complete control of their immigration policy so leaving would do almost nothing when it comes to immigration policy. Not to mention that 70% of Britain's population increase came from immigration. Limiting immigration radically could have some pernicious effects.

death penalty,"Opening Arguments : The system of law and order is all about justice but where do draw the line to were we become the very evil we wish to destroy. Murder is murder and capital punishment is just that murder, simple to just kill killers but what does that make you? It makes you a killer but with public opinion on your side and a notion of justice which isn't the case. Why is it that America holds a sanctity for life, and yet kill people for killing people how does that make sense its hypocritical. Case: 1. The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However it doesn't work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but then proven innocent after the sentence has already been carried out the government just goes oops sorry. 2. Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled ""Death Penalty and Sentencing Information,"" wrote: ""Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases.

death penalty,"The death penalty has a purpose. People who have killed many and even thousands cant be sentence to death? Death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that's so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. If there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. Death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. If you think the Death penalty is bad because it kills people you must not know what the purpose of it is. The death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others. Crime has decreased and the death penalty still lives. Several tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes. Do people who commit heinous crimes, such as the bombers, really have human rights. To say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. Killing over 200 innocent lives. We have to look as well at the possibilities of these criminals committing crimes again. In Australia murder, on average, is imprisonment for 12 years. This means many murders are set free, able to commit further crimes. Benefits of death penalty - decreases jail over population - puts fear into other criminals and shows a purpose - It avenges innocent lives - It decreases crime.

But i'm not using facts or sources. If you need a reason on why the death penalty is a good idea; here are a few. One small but important reason on why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money. Another reason why the death penalty is a good idea, Once a criminal is executed, he cannot kill again. The case for this would be Kenneth Allen McDuff who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970's. His sentence was commuted to life and he was eventually released on parole and killed again. He has since been executed My final reason for this round is that the death penalty is actually a very good deterrence. If you look at this link: http://www.prodeathpenalty.com... You see a chart.

death penalty,"For the most part, these are correct, although there are some grey areas, but do not concern yourself with that. One mistake i made is that in some cases the death penalty is not COMPLETELY painless, but i was wanting to make the point that in most cases, it's less painful than a lot of deaths. ""The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars"". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything some families struggle for, for free, and thats fair? And that doesn't waste money? If a person is sentenced to life in prison at age 37, at age 77, on average, it will cost a state more than $4 million dollars. (http://www.phoenix.edu...) I would like an explanation on how the death penalty costs more. ""Innocent people are too often executed"". Please show me cases where people are wrongly executed in the last 20 years or so. The death penalty is not used nearly as much, so i would like some elabortation. ""The death penalty is applied in an unfair manner"". I must have elabortation on this also. Another point i must make, the death penalty is a source of intimidation. If someone kwows the death penalty is strictly enforced, more than likely that person will think twice about committing the crime. Its common sense, if someone knows there are consequences, if a person understands that their life will be taken if they take someone else's life, less crimes will be committed. Now the death penalty is used more and more lightly and criminals know that more than likely nothing too terribly harmful will happen if they were to commit crimes.

death penalty,"Ahhh, the death penalty. The government taking someone's life because they took someone else's life. What obvious hypocrisy. I disagree with the death penalty because it is immoral.

Second, the death penalty becomes intolerable the very moment that someone is wrongly convicted. Death is, if anything, permanent.

death penalty,"Ok how can you say that it is usual to strap a person down to a table and inject him with poisons that will kill him. how is it usual to strap a person to a chair with sponges up there buts and masks over there face to keep them from vomiting and craping all over the place while your send thousands of volts through there body there is not anything usual about that. when on death row you have a unlimited amout of appeals that are all paid for by our court systems. plus various other expences so yes even an 18 yr old sitting in jail for the rest of there life is cheaper then the death penalty. infact it cost. At the trial level, death penalty cases are estimated to generate roughly $470,000 inadditional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty and costs of $47,000 to $70,000 for court personnel. On direct appeal, the cost of appellate defense averages $100,000 more in death penalty cases, than in non-death penalty murder cases.

death penalty,"I deem the death penalty to be necessary. Morally, it is senseless that a serial killer would not face death as a punishment for their multiple crimes. Again, I could go into the devastational effects on the families of the victims, which harms many more people than it would the family of a serial killer, but you would argue I would be creating more pain by killing the killer. I cannot understand why a family would continue to support said killer, however it may happen. You have discounted economics and all other sensible retort I may have had, so it would be pointless me highlighting the economic benefits of the death penalty. You may personally be opposed to the death penalty, but, as is apparent in the Unite States, the people evidently want the death penalty, else they would proposition the banishment in their own state. Regardless if it actually deters crime or not, ""the majority"" want the death penalty: http://www.gallup.com... The above is only one example of a poll, and there are more to be found should you require . I concede that the Government has too many powers as it stands, however if they are to maintain any degree of PERCEPTION of justice, it would be a wise move to include the death penalty. Regardless of its effectiveness, it still puts the public mind at ease. All too commonly, we read comments in newspapers referencing the death penalty and the revival of it. To put my position bluntly, I will use an example. If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and letting them sizzle in 100 degree heat in the desert of Arizona, I would be opposed to the death penalty. However, this is NOT the case, most especially here in Britain. Some prisons are palatial. If the ""Arpaio model"" was adopted, I would deem that apt and just punishment, considering their life would be in more misery than if they were dead. That is certainly punishment in the true sense of the word. For as long as Britain continues to send prisoners to tax-funded 5* hotels, I deem the death penalty a worthy inclusion to the system.",PRO,"If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and",361,"['0.0028650787193328143', '0.9971349120140076']",0.0028650787193328,0.9971349120140076,391,"I deem the death penalty to be necessary.

death penalty,"First I have to say sorry to my opponent for one missing the second round resulting in a forfeit. Second, for the lack of my free time I cannot give this argument my full effort, but will still try to convince the viewers of my position. 1) I agree that life imprisonment could easily be interpreted as cruel and unusual, however, with the death penalty, society focuses on vengeance and punishment, but with life imprisonment we can focus on rehabilitation and forgiveness. The death penalty gives the accused no chance of turning their life around, and is often sought out of vengeance of families of the victims, however the death penalty brings little to no closure of the families. These botched executions are unacceptable and because there is no humane method of killing, none shall be used. 2) As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. My opponent argues that trials shall be done faster and more efficiently, however that will just result in more mistakes, cause after all, we are all human, we all make mistakes, not just criminals. 3) I accept my opponent's argument that use of the death penalty doesn't correlate with murder rates, however I still state that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent. My opponent claims that more use of the death penalty would result in better deterrence, I admit this is possible, but it would not be a good thing for society, which is the original argument. An excessive use of the death penalty creates fear in society, which would be one method of deterrence, however with life imprisonment and the injection of morals into society. That way, society as a whole could get a better grasp on what is right and wrong. 4) Ok, all I have is one question: How many innocent people can be executed before the death penalty should stop being used? 5) The video doesn't relate to any one point, I feel that it helps express my overall feeling of the topic. http://www.youtube.com...",CON,"2) As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. ... http://www.youtube.com...",363,"['0.4478765822947025', '0.5521234210580588']",0.4478765822947025,0.5521234210580588,355,"The death penalty gives the accused no chance of turning their life around, and is often sought out of vengeance of families of the victims.

death penalty,"There are many ""crimes"" for which death penalty is applied that are not really high. For example, a woman was killed with death penalty in the United States just because she was alone in a mall. Do you think that just because this is prohibided it is a crime? No, it just a violation of laws in the country that she can correct with some time in the jail. With the death penalty many ""crimes"" like this are beeing punished. A discovery channel investigation shows that countries that alredy abolish death penalty have less criminals, because they have not any scare feelings about it. But some people are afraid of the jail and take out the idea of beeing criminals. How is death penalty not going to be the easy way if you think that the way of having less criminals is take them out of the world? The best way to stop it is to make them change and say sorry and if you try that, even if you don't achieve it, that will not be the easy way. Death penalty is a revenge. Let's suppose that a person violates someone and the victim kills him. Yu will clearly say that it is revenge, but if the government do the same, you will say that not. Human rights are equal for EVERYONE, even if the government is superior, they have to respect human rights of everyone, can not decide what to do with the life of people and can't take revenge replacing another person just because they are superior. If death penalty really helps, why does the countries that alredy abolish it have less criminals? Take the example of Donald Calloway. He was a criminal since he was 15 years old. he scaped from the jail. In a moment when he transformed to catholic religion, he say sorry to God and cry for his criminal acts. He also became priest and tell everyone his story. What would happen if he was killed with death penalty. People, take this story as an example!

So that we are on the same page, The listed definition of safe is; protected from or not exposed to danger or risk; not likely to be harmed or lost.

Even then of the countless number of ways that we have tried to guarantee safety through history--we have never been able to. ""Crime"" does exist within the populace and it is the only 100% certainty I see.

The Cummunist Manifesto “Let the guzzling classes tremble at a Cummunist revolution. The harlotarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!” –Karl “Big Gulp” Marx The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain’t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.",CON,"Definitions: Veganismis the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals ",463,"['0.060740009695291516', '0.9392599821090698']",0.0607400096952915,0.9392599821090698,329,"Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals.

vegan,"Meat eaters are not ignorant in my opinion. I am sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one. Being at least one of the things on the preceding list should disqualify ignorance as a reason for eating meat. Personally, I enjoy meat because of preference. I understand what happens on farms, factories, butcher shops, restaurants, etc with meat. More selfish? Well, what's selfish? Selfish seems to mean that one cares for one's self without any regards to others. I will agree that selfish is a proper word to use. Meat eaters take advantage of life on earth for personal gain and pleasure. However, we as humans are way past selfish all together. Anyone taking part in the industrial revolution and the results of it are selfish. We take advantage of earth and the things of it for our own personal gain or pleasure. We chop down trees, we dirty up water, we burn oil and coal, we dig and landscape every other acre of earth, we capture animals and genetically change them to be our fluffy pets instead of letting them roam free in the environment, we run over squirrels, and instead of eating food that grows from our surroundings, we destroy land that is already there, plant new plants that aren't natural to the area, and then they take the crops and turn them in to something more desired. Simply put, humans are selfish. We all do things that destroy the environment for our personal gain with little regards for the environment. So, we as humans are selfish and care less about others for our own personal reasons. If this debate is how vegans are better and smarter than meat eaters, than this debate is not a good idea. You and I (I'm assuming you're a vegan) are only different because of our eating choices. We are both, at the end of the day are selfish, less caring beings because we are humans.

vegan,"I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's ""semenal work"". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is ""seminal"", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious. Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then ""finish the job"" by swallowing his muck will ""remove antagonism"" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity.

nuclear energy,"I'm in favour for nuclear energy. For economical reasons, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Like my opponent said, nuclear power plants are expensive to build and we need to use energy for building it. But the main mistake that we make is we are looking too close to this subject. Nuclear power plant is an energy source which can give us highly more energy then others. If we compare a nuclear power plant with thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy will gain us what we lost while we're building the centrals. And the ending of the fossil fuels are really close(1). We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy has many radioactive wastes. But I think that we can agree on something: The worlds most important problem is Global Worming. It will destroy us slowly. And that's why we're our children to be careful and be aware of the effects of global warming. Now whit this fabulous energy type, we have a chance to and the global warming. For the effects of nuclear power plants, I need you to know that 95% of the energy generated by nuclear burn up is without any waste of CO2. So we should use nuclear energy to stop our biggest problem in the world. For the risks, Nuclear radiation is risky but the radiation will leave the central only if there is a crack in the central. We had seen it in Chernobyl, but now, we have a better technology and better scientist. We need to trust on our people to make this energy useful. Secondly., radiation is an important factor but we can't prove that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course it will effect the human health but ,we, people experience a lot of technological devices in our daily lives, like phones or televisions.

I've done some research and found that Donald Trump has some unstable qualities. He declared himself god in his last debate. Also, what have Iraq and Syria done to us? WHY do you we need to blow them off the face of the Earth? That could start a world war that would end very badly. It's our government's job, also, to help people looking for a better life coming to the states. In closing, we as a union should not vote for Donald Trump.

donald trump,"I will start off with some definitions. Definitions Sith- ancient kratocratic organization wielding the dark side of the Force, typically using crimson lightsabers and attempting to achieve great power. Kratocratic- government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning. Arguments Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power- One of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruction. Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government. Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power. Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist. Donald Trump's asinine claims about Mexican criminals being ""rapists"" and ""murderers"" are akin to the Sith's attempts to criminalize the Jedi near the fall of the Old Republic. Donald Trump wears Sith garments and command a legion of soldiers- Donald Trump has been observed wearing traditional Sith cloaks, and has been seen commanding armies of Stormtroopers. This guarantees his connection with the Dark Side. [1][2] Sources http://i60.tinypic.com...;[1] http://i62.tinypic.com...",PRO,"I will start off with some definitions.
