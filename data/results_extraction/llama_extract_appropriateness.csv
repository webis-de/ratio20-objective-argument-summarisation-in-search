4	Gun control is largely ineffective at reducing crime as criminals will always find a way to access guns, while well-armed citizens can act as a deterrent. Furthermore, the Second Amendment is intended to ensure that citizens can protect themselves against an overreaching government.
5	Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong, which confuses young men and leads to a lack of understanding of what is wrong and right. Consequently, this can lead to sexual activity such as rape.

7	China is oppressive to its citizens and any dissent is met with severe punishments like beatings and torture. America turns a blind eye to this in favor of preserving economic relations, which involves outsourcing labor to slave-like conditions.

10	Scott Peterson was an average white guy, like OJ Simpson but without the celebrity status. He and Laci were nice-looking, which made for good television, just like Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction.
11	Hamas' agenda of destroying Israel makes it acceptable for Israel to take retaliatory action against them. Furthermore, Hamas' refusal to accept cease-fires and their disregard for civilian casualties during missile launches from civilian buildings make Israel's actions justified.
12	The government shouldn't be in the marriage business, and should simply record marriages and grant equal rights to all couples. Plural marriages exist, but there is no support for them.

14	Bad Company 2 is boring due to its lack of intensity and interesting gameplay, while Call of Duty's maps are too big and vehicle controls are difficult. MW2 is exciting and immersive with its realistic weapons and gameplay.

16	Democracy and western values are not likely to succeed in conflict countries due to their lack of a shared Enlightenment background and the requirement in Islam for church and state to be unified with the rule of law coming from the Koran.

17	It is morally wrong to violate someone's rights, however, laws should not hinder an individual's right to practice their religious beliefs or infringe upon their personal freedoms.

19	The expectation that men should put the toilet seat down after urinating is unreasonable because it cannot be applied equally to both sexes, as women would have to put the seat up after using it and it would cancel out. Additionally, in a shared building or household, the next user may be a man who will need to put the seat up again.
20	Ladies bars have not been shut down in India, but instead Maharashtra's government implemented the ban due to complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not taking care of their families.

22	The Stormcloaks are portrayed as the villains of the civil war in Skyrim due to their racism, abuse and mistreatment of people different from them, as well as Ulfric's use of the Thu'um to kill the High King. This leaves them with nothing that paints them as the good guys, aside from not being the ones who want to cut your head off at the beginning of the quest line.
23	India has the potential to lead the world, given its large number of IIT-educated scientists working at NASA and its high rate of IIT qualifiers.

30	Latinos come from a variety of different backgrounds, and it is unfair to judge an entire culture by the actions of a few. Everyone should be held responsible for their own actions, regardless of their culture, and no one should use their culture as an excuse.
31	Earth is facing many urgent problems that need to be addressed, and space exploration is not a priority. Investing in space exploration is a waste of time and resources, as it will not prevent the imminent threat of global warming and its resulting destruction.
32	Smoking ban is mainly a social engineering tool used to generate revenue, not a matter of public health.

35	Although some may argue that banning teenage sexuality is the best approach to take, it is not feasible and will likely do more harm than good. People are entitled to make their own decisions in
36	Israel should have been established within the borders of Germany following the Second World War as an independent state in order to better protect Jewish people, who were victims of the Nazis. Annexing a portion of Germany, instead of Palestine, would have been a more morally justifiable option as it would have provided a safer location for Jewish people,
37	Massachusetts melanie's law is likely to be passed and implemented without fully considering the consequences and long term effects, relying instead on emotion and headlines. Any good law should be based on reason and logic, not speculation.

42	Insurance companies are allowed to profile customers but law enforcement is not because insurance companies are selling a product and profiling customers allows them to more accurately determine risk and pricing, while law enforcement's use of profiling can have much more serious consequences. Furthermore, insurance companies are competing in a free market where customers can choose between companies, whereas law enforcement is a coercive institution that is not subject to the same kinds of consumer pressures
43	Men should be able to piss sitting down if they want to because it has nothing to do with being gay and is not related to sexuality. Doing so can be beneficial in certain situations, such as when a man has morning wood and needs to take a piss, or when one is in a rush and has to take a piss quickly.
44	Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members, but this sounds like it goes a little far unless your bf has done something like cross a picket line, which would make him not well-liked and respected and could be seen as him "being a rat and a scab".

47	The Founding Fathers recognized the importance of taxation in funding the common good, as evidenced by the various colony governments and construction projects which were financed with tax money. Despite the fact that taxation without representation was a grievance of the Revolution, the Found
48	The government and private citizens should not be able to invade people's privacy, while the media is allowed to as it serves an important watchdog role in holding the powerful to account.

49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people that 9/11 was an inside job, but there are some who are difficult to convince due to faith-based reasons.

59	The United States incarcerates over 1/3 of the world's prison population despite having only 1/20th of the world's population. This is partly due to the nation's long-standing "war on crime" and "war on drugs" policies, which have led to increased incarceration rates despite falling crime rates.

66	The Patriot Act was passed without anyone in Congress reading it, and this raises questions about the effectiveness of Congress, as no one appears to be doing their job. This highlights a need for term limits, to ensure that no one stays in Congress for too long, and to ensure that fresh, new ideas are introduced.
67	People love to quote pop culture references in their comments, but it's a sign of a lack of original thought and a vacuous infanthood. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn about this trend.

69	In most states, the legal majority age is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that require support for a minor child until the age of 18 or until they graduate high school.

75	The man should not have been arrested or forced to register as a sex offender. He should have received a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society and the daughter should have received a lecture on not running into the street.
76	Our freedom was achieved through standing up for what we believe in, and we can only hope that other countries can learn from our example and make peace through similar means. Unfortunately, many people have become complacent and neglected their responsibility to make the world a better place.

82	Nancy Pelosi does not have the authority to forcefully remove an elected official from office unless the official has committed an illegal act or engaged in gross misconduct.

88	Minimum wage jobs are typically unskilled or low-skilled jobs that don't require any specialized training or knowledge, and often don't even involve any sort of meaningful intellectual challenge.

89	I believe that if a person has the strength to kill themselves, they also have the strength to keep living. It's pointless to consider or act on suicide when you have the will to go on.
