Is porn wrong:,"The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap.

Sadism is the most evil thing a human can indulge in.   stance: yes:,"Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is ""evil"".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just ""assisted"" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
Pick this apart at your will.","['Toxic Emotions', 'Excessive Intensity']",144,"In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence.

Do lesbians have it easier than gay men??   stance: lesbians are more socially accepted by straight people:,"In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)
Additionally, gay women are more ""socially acceptable,"" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is ""lowering himself"" to a women's level.
Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.

Why did the scott peterson case get so much media attention?:,"Scott Peterson was the white juxtapostion to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an ""everyman."" Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were nice looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us. 1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant. 2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off.

Should same sex marriages be legal?:,"This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural ""marriages,""  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.

_____

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death?

Are democracy and western values really the answer for conflict countries?:,"You can't export Democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government.  Muslim countries do not have the Enlightenment background we had in the nascent United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic.  Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran.  Despite the attempts by some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience.  Islam needs to go through their own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed.

Why are insurance companies allowed to profile but law enforcement isnt?:,"Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.

In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and tossed them in to the water. 

I cant find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. 

At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, faught for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over.

Cmv: i believe the idea that healthy food is more expensive than junk is a myth perpetuated by fatties:,"This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive,  then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas...  several kilos of food here for less than £4. if you have a big enough freezer you can even buy chicken breast in bulk thatll last months (£48/10kg here)...Then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain healthy food is expensive)","['Toxic Emotions', 'Excessive Intensity', 'Missing Commitment', 'Missing Openness']",122,In the UK you can buy several kilos of food for less than £4.

Why is yahoo! answers politically and/or racially biased?:,"Yeah, it's biased.  But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet subject search records of Americans over to Bush and Co. in the administration's guise of cracking down on porn?  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda.

And it was dumb to pose that question.  It is a crime to threaten the President and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way--especially by this president.  But I've noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then are fine with it.  I'm sure most conservatives are like that.","['Toxic Emotions', 'Excessive Intensity', 'Emotional Deception', 'Missing Commitment', 'Missing Openness', 'Missing Intelligibility', 'Missing Relevance']",143,CNN's John Sutter says Yahoo Answers is biased.

Cmv: adhd and autism isn't a disease but the next step or human evolution.:,"I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math science or music, which is fantastic.

Hypocrites?:,"Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other peoples opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.

In many cases it could be conservatism is masquarading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything.

"Cmv: road kill doesn't matter, a netural response to seeing an animal being killed is fine:","Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured , then killed by other cars passing over it.

My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will at bit unpleasant is not something one should show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another Field. I am a wage earner, I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road. 

It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way.

This is not about arguing weather road kill is bad or good for the enviroment, rather my own emotional reaction to seeing a animal die senselessly. I am arguing it is fine to experience no emotion.

I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community.
If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it.

What should happen to saddam if he is found guilty?:,"The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and
will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty.

But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq.The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the Glaring eyes & stance when in court he recently told the judge""I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?""

The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddams case. Which country
would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts?

No. The chair will probably decay &break, and the switches/
wires will rust or melt away.And dont suggest a rope, because there is no such strong rope exists in the World to snap such a
strong throat.","['Toxic Emotions', 'Excessive Intensity', 'Missing Commitment', 'Missing Openness', 'Missing Intelligibility', 'Missing Relevance', 'Confusing Reasoning']",150,"The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty.
