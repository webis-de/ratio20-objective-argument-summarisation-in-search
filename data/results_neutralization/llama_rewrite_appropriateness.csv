0	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and preventing possible future sexual assaults, is not valid. Porn is definitely wrong. After a dosage, the guilt of wasting one's time, energy, and effort will almost kill you. Trust me. It's a road that should not be taken, it's as bad as smoking and drugs. I think the only reason it is not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
1	No, I haven't but it sounds like it might be a friend in need. There may be help available through pro-bono services or low income based legal services that she could take advantage of. You'd be surprised at what some places consider low income. My sister's husband brings home at least $400 a week in winter and at least $600 a week in summer, and they have a three-person household. They earn approximately $46,000 a year and receive help from WIC, daycare assistance, food stamps, and more. Tell her to look into these services.
2	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".  However, where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine. Pick this apart at your will.
3	I believe that investing in research to create hybrid animals has the potential to be immensely beneficial, both financially and scientifically. For example, creating a half gorilla-half octopus could result in an incredibly powerful animal with two legs and six waving arms, as well as a furry face. While it is true that creating such creatures might cost a lot and might hurt some animals, I believe the outcome would make it all worthwhile. Imagine being able to have a turtle with a chicken head wandering around your house - it would certainly be a unique pet!  Thus, I do not believe the "don't play god" argument holds much weight, as I am confident the results of such research would be incredible.
4	That's just stereotypical thinking. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat, or some other object. It's not helpful to enact "feel good" legislation that makes liberals feel like they're doing something to combat crime while letting the criminals run rampant. Statistics show that when a well-armed citizen is present, criminal activity lessens and crime rates drop. Additionally, the Second Amendment exists to guarantee the citizenry the right to bear arms and provide the ability to resist an overreaching government. A hunting rifle is hardly a match for a machine gun.
5	Being horny is a sin.  Wanking is a sin.  Having sex with your girlfriend is not wrong.  Raping is not wrong either, but putting the two in the same context of a “sin” is causing confusion and potentially leading to such acts.  We should teach morals, not religion, to young men so that they can have a clear understanding of what is right and wrong.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic.  (Vice versa for gay men.)  Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.  Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.  Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
7	This guy's actually got a point. I'm not so sure on the specifics of any Yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances of beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore it because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths...what is the difference?
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things will still happen to you. Conversely you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. Often, those who take risks and play aggressively get ahead while those who do right by others but don't take risks or push for what they want don't get as far. This is not fair, but it's the way the world works. One should not give up on kindness and fairness, but be aware that in life, one may have to take risks and take charge in order to get ahead.  In the end, life is not fair, but it is important to learn from one's experiences and be prepared to take risks if one wants to get ahead.
10	Scott Peterson was the antithesis to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an everyday person. Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were good-looking people, so the TV images were appealing. We watched it for the same reasons we watched Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average everyday white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is home pregnant, his version of reality went awry. It was a warning sign to the rest of us.  1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f*cking you while your wife was pregnant.   2) If you're an average everyday white guy, you won't get off scott free like OJ got away with it. It still seems that a black celebrity can work their celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
11	Israel has every right to retaliate against Hamas for the hundreds of missiles that have been fired into Israel over the past two weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to secure a cease-fire. Hamas's refusal to accept a peaceful resolution has left Israel with no choice but to take action to protect its citizens. Additionally, Hamas' goal of destroying Israel means that neutralizing the group is essential for ensuring the safety of Israelis. Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively using civilians as human shields by firing missiles from within civilian buildings. Finally, the invasion of Gaza is necessary to prevent further attacks on Israel.
12	This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural "marriages,"  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most committed couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. After three years, you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by, as if they are simply going through the motions, with the only aim being to become another statistic for the department they are in. Worst of all, it seems like no one even notices. For example, with my final year project, I was highly motivated and enjoyed it immensely, but it seemed that everyone else wanted it to end quickly - no passion for what they had created. Therefore, it seems that universities are not here to serve humanity, but instead is just a machine for producing figures for the corporate world.
14	Bad Company 2 is boring as it is difficult to kill people, the controls are awkward with vehicles, the maps are too big, and people hate the size and scope of the Battlefield maps.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, however, has intense gameplay due to its unpredictability. You never know what's around the corner or if an enemy is waiting to ambush you with a sniper rifle or a thrown grenade. Additionally, with fewer magazines and skills to develop, you have to be more strategic in your approach in MW2. Weapons are also more realistic, save for the AT4 which is not a guided munition. Overall, Battlefield is boring in comparison to MW2 due to its lack of intensity and unpredictability.
15	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will inform the public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).
16	You can't export democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government.  Muslim countries do not have the same Enlightenment background that we had in the nascent United States when forming a secular constitutional republic.  Islam demands that church and state be united, with the rule of law coming from the Quran.  Despite the attempts of some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government, allowing citizens to follow the dictates of their own conscience.  Islam needs to go through its own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed.  Until then, we can only keep (weak) control by military force, which creates its own blowback as we now see in the Middle East.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught and can have serious repercussions. However, people tend to bend laws and break laws sometimes, especially when the penalty is not severe, such as speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. Any law would be right if it doesn't infringe upon the realms of Human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can try to fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify it. However, that is a very tiring and exhaustive process.
18	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk, also known as Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o) Anyway, back to the subject at hand. TP's Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk.
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).   The argument is that it's considerate, but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out.   And in a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again.   Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women?   Putting the seat up after use is a reasonable request as it minimizes any discomfort the next user may experience. Furthermore, it is unfair to expect men to constantly put the seat up after use as it cancels out the expectation that men should put the seat down after use.
20	You are wrong, they have not been shut down in India. The government had shut them down due to numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not taking care of their families. Additionally, criminal activities often took place at these bars, such as the Tarannum and Telgi cases, where Tarannum was earning around 1 lakh per month and Telgi was throwing away near 1 lac per day on bar girls. To put a stop to such activities, the Government of Maharashtra imposed the ban.
21	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, and I don't think that should change. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no issue with that, but they should not be rewarded with tax breaks. Additionally, I don't want them to have a platform to spread their views and corrupt the minds of my children. Homosexuality may be a learned behavior, but that doesn't mean it should be condoned. If morality goes, then so does society, and I don't want my children to grow up in a world like that.
22	The argument presented is that the Stormcloaks being portrayed as the exclusive bad guys of the Civil War in Skyrim makes the quest line and story weaker. The main points presented to support this argument are that the Stormcloaks are racist, abusive, and use dark magic, making them the “villains” by modern morales. Additionally, Ulfric's use of the Thu'um to kill the High King further enforces the argument that the Stormcloaks are the antagonists.   To CMV, it could be argued that the Stormcloaks being the only bad guys in the civil war is an oversimplification, and that there is more complexity to the situation. Additionally, it could be argued that the Stormcloaks have their own motivations and perspectives which complicate the situation. Furthermore, it could be argued that the narrative of the Civil War in Skyrim makes clear the moral and ethical grey areas of the conflict, and portrays the Stormcloaks, and Ulfric in particular, as not being as black and white as they initially seem.
23	According to a recent report, half of the scientists at NASA are Indians from the Indian Institute of Technology. Imagine what would happen if these scientists joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). India's status, value, and astronomical knowledge would undoubtedly increase. Now, think about IITians - students who are qualified to attend the IIT. They are known to be "superbrains". If India is capable of establishing high-tech institutions, then why are we unable to provide them with suitable jobs of their level? We are giving them an international status of education. Why are we unable to take full advantage of this? This is due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, an unsuitable working environment, and low salaries. It is therefore the need of the hour to improve India's industrial sector.
24	All these arguments about porn "leadership" being a major issue are starting to get on my nerves. Porn hardly ever leads to "addiction" in normal people, just in those with mental health issues, attachment issues or difficulty differentiating fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when I'm alone but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if I'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
25	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]
26	So you dispute the Pontius Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter.  Hippie? I believe "nomad" would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. Sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie.  And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.  And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption. The whole controversy is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eye witness accounts claim that He did. What can you say to prove that He didn't?
27	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was originally implemented for 15 years or the implementation of the Mandal commission after years of lying dormant. There are many aspects of reservation. It is a fact that there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.  However, there is opposition to reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are being taken up by some people of these societies who are already in the upper class. These people are exploiting the system and the real needy are still at the same place. No one would object if a really needy person gets the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not in need who is reaping the benefits.
28	I would say not all foreigners are seen as negatively as some Russian people may perceive them. It is understandable that some countries may have favorites and unfavorites, and Russia is no exception. The reasons for disliking certain foreigners may depend on the country they are from, as well as the individual's experiences. Not all foreigners are as violent, dishonest, and unkind as the worst offenders in the world. It is the government that is responsible for a country's actions, and it is the Russian people who ultimately pay for it.
29	Yes, freedom of speech should be unrestricted when it comes to religious statements. Freedom of speech is a right that should not be taken away, even if it means facing the consequences of those statements. We should respect the rights of individuals to express themselves, even if it may be considered offensive to some. Furthermore, we should also exercise our right to free speech responsibly and thoughtfully and consider the potential implications of our words and actions.
30	I just don't know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people, born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have a similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all Latinos are the same, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different from the rest of Latin America.  You don't say to an Irishman he is British, or to a Canadian he is American, or to a Basque he is Spanish. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
31	I don't think it's a wise use of resources to focus on exploring space instead of dealing with our own planet's more pressing issues, such as world poverty, overpopulation, pollution, and the biggest threat of all - global warming. Scientists should prioritize fixing our own problems first, before attempting to make other planets more habitable for life. If we don't succeed and everyone ends up dying, it'll be a tragic waste of resources and time.
32	I believe that the choice of whether or not to allow smoking should be left up to the individual business owners, rather than the government. I've yet to be to a place where smoke has bothered me, as most establishments here in Ohio are non-smoking anyway. Bars may not be the most pleasant the next day after smelling my clothes and hair, but my breath certainly doesn't smell any worse than it does after a night of drinks. This is just another way for people to control and make money; the ballot measure is worded so that money from it will go towards the "clean air fund". If smoking is banned, why would we need this fund? What will they do with the money? I'd rather keep my money to put towards my child's college fund.
33	I can understand why the "culture of life" Republicans are not protesting this abuse of power - this poor woman is not a middle-class white woman, she is an immigrant and her family is not being torn to shreds over an agonizing decision about which they don't agree. It is not an election year and the President is in enough hot water with the public without having this situation getting the same headlines that the Schiavo case garnered.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this vast expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option.  I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
35	People are free to make their own decisions in life. Yes, maybe it sucks that there are consequences to this, but really you sound unreasonable! Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty. Maybe you should teach your kids about responsibility and communication, so that they can make informed decisions. Overcrowding in jails is a problem now, so imagine what it would be like if people were thrown in jail for just expressing themselves. You can't stop anyone from doing what they want to do. You should know that from when you were younger. The more you discourage it, the more they will want to do it. People have that right. Even teenagers. That's the only way they learn.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary due to the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location when an alternate location could provide the same protection with minimal risk? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine due to a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.
37	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.  Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.  That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People — voters or legislators — pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.  And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
38	Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly, I support Christianity because of my "faith in God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
39	I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion, but I know that in my heart, it is wrong and not an option for me. But I would much rather have these women who have their mind set on doing it go to a clean, sterile facility and not some rusty shack and put their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, etc. I think everyone knows it isn't morally right - they are not motivated to have an abortion because it is morally right, I think. They choose to because of situational factors. And I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their choice, but they felt that was their only way out.
40	Ethically, if your father's insurance goes up due to the accident, you should pay it since it will likely be reviewed within six months. However, the good news is this is just life's lessons learned. You got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. Your friend got a ticket because they were at fault - let's assume there is a big doctor bill. You are probably insured on your father's policy since you were not at fault. Your friend has the problem and they are totally responsible for it. They let you use the car, so if there is a big claim it will come out of their pocket - this is their problem, not yours. I don't see this as an ethical problem for you since you are insured.
41	I understand your parents' point that your family won't be around forever, and that they would do anything for you. However, I think it's important to prioritize your relationships with your family members, regardless of whether you like them or not. While you may not need or want their help or support, it does not negate the fact that they are your family and they care about you. Your parents are probably worried that if you don't maintain these relationships, you may regret it in the future. In any case, it's up to you to decide how you want to handle the situation.
42	Dear Friend,  I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling consists of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.  But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies, on the other hand, sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.  Your Friend, Francois
43	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multitask by brushing my teeth while I peed sitting down. A few days later, I was feeling lazy, so I just decided to sit while I peed. Over time I've become more comfortable with this practice, and now I often multitask by sitting to pee while brushing my teeth and sometimes even just sitting when I'm feeling too lazy to stand. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to pee so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to pee with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean that it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.
44	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker?  Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your boyfriend has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab.  As for the other man, is he really an illegal alien? Then the INS could come in and send him back.  You know unionism grows only when employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how, as a group.   Unions are not all demons nor is management always the enemy, however, if that's how management and union posture themselves then there won't be any kind of labour peace.
45	Throughout the debate over the Washington Redskins name, I have frequently heard the argument that the team name is equivalent to having a team named the Detroit Niggers.  This is illogical: Firstly, when has anyone ever heard the word 'Redskin' outside of discussing the professional football team? Has anyone used it out of hatred? I cannot say for certain, but I doubt it. However, 'Redskin' is not remotely similar to using the N word, simply because of how the word is used in context.
46	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know. Furthermore, advancing the common good is important and should not be overlooked, so it's important to find a balance between the two.
47	There is no provision in either document you cite which says that keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom.   Now, our founding fathers were involved in colony governments before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights.   When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation without representation, we were not opposed to taxation. We never have been.   You have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society. Plus, you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.
48	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person. It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications. However, we have the right to know what the government is doing—because it’s with our money. Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us. Any argument that the Fourth Amendment protects our privacy from the government is naive—the Fourth Amendment has been effectively nullified by Social Security Numbers, gun records, increasing search and seizure to look for a “probable cause,” phone tapping, and the vast, powerful nature of the government.
49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly based on faith in the government, and a desire to not believe that their government could carry out a massacre of its own citizens. Unfortunately, it is likely that many of these people will wake up when the country is under Martial law, with curfews in place and citizens reduced to prisoners in their own homes.  For the unlucky few, their fate will be far worse. They will be sent to one of the 600+ concentration camps that have already been built and are waiting for their arrival.
50	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art". But hasn't almost all installation art since then been Duchamp's Fountain over and over again? A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc.  Almost all contemporary installation art is criminally dull and boring. The 100th attempt at asking the question 'what is art' just leaves me dripping with apathy.  The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh as people walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, it's the opposite. They're proudly put on display.  I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
51	Impeachment of George W. Bush is necessary, given his criminal actions and egregious misconduct as President of the United States. Many have noted his war crimes and crimes against humanity, and these egregious offenses cannot be ignored. We must take action to hold Bush accountable, and thereby demonstrate to the world that the United States will not tolerate such behavior from its leaders. Furthermore, impeaching Bush will enable the country to have new leadership, with the potential for improved policies and a better future. Therefore, let us vote for impeaching George W. Bush.
52	At Poland Spring, we know that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.  To maintain the purity of our water, we employ a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system that involves carefully controlled and continuously monitored disinfection processes in hygienically designed lines. We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. Every year, we screen for over 200 possible contaminants-far more than state and federal regulations require. By taking these extra steps to ensure the safety and quality of our water, we can be sure that it always meets the highest standards of quality and purity.
53	Do you want to be able to have contact with your children? Then you need to take a stand and fight for them. California generally awards fathers with a fair amount of parental rights and responsibility. Unless you are found unfit for some reason, your children have the legal right to have contact with you. Furthermore, if you have a court order, you should hire an attorney who specializes in family law within the jurisdiction of the latest court order. This is important because you need to do everything in your power to fight for this. Your kids need to be able to have a strong relationship with their father, and it is likely that they may suffer long-term psychological consequences if you don't. So it's in everyone's best interest that you take the necessary steps to ensure that this doesn't happen.
54	I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or an extremely bad start in life. However, the majority of poor Americans are content, and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society. I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I feel lazy much of the time, having to remind myself that the world we've created does not work that way, that we must work for everything we get. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in third-world countries having to work their whole lives just to survive, yet we have grown up on video games and easy high school.
55	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, I just don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science.    I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone.    Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
56	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, then if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However this would only be the case of course if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
57	Not really because you didn't fill out an accident report and your work will argue you did it at home and you have no proof that you did it on the job. That's why, even for a minor cut, you should report it to your supervisor and make sure your back is properly documented. Did you tell anyone your back was hurting before you left work? If so, they will have to sign an affidavit saying you did hurt yourself on the job and put their job in jeopardy, which could lead to them losing their job. If you do hire a lawyer, be prepared to fight a long and powerful battle and know that, in the end, you will most likely lose. It's best to go to the chiropractor, keep your job, and mark this as a lesson to tell someone the next time the cost of losing your job is more than a couple hundred dollars. Whenever you fill out an application, I don't care what anyone says, your employer can blackball you and tell them what happened, which can make it much harder to get another job.
58	YES!  Why should we continue to punish those who are simply too lazy to find legal employment or are victims of a broken criminal justice system? Furthermore, why do we let wife beaters go free while imprisoning people who smoke marijuana? This policy does not make sense. "It's been illegal for a long time" is no justification for maintaining an unjust law. If spitting in the street were illegal in some places, would you also advocate throwing people in jail for that? Hopefully not, since that would be absurd. Fortunately, some states are beginning to recognize the senselessness of these marijuana laws and are beginning to reform them. Those interested in this issue should visit the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) website. We should all wake up and smell the coffee; marijuana prohibition is both ineffective and unjust.
59	I just attended a lecture yesterday that addressed these very statistics. Our crime rate is actually going down, but our incarceration rate is rising. This is reflective of the United States' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" campaigns that began in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Reagan-led mainly). We are more heavily relying on incarceration as a solution, thus accounting for the sharp increase in prison populations. To accurately assess these numbers, you must also look at the crime rates of all these nations, as well as our own poor performance. African-Americans have an incarceration rate of over 6,000 per 100,000, which is even worse than the already-poor national average.
60	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Well either way, yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then he/she is hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive way. That doesn't mean they should not be allowed to vote. On the other hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should not be allowed to--especially if they are repeat offenders.
61	I lived in Austin, Texas from 2000 to 2007 and had access to Rudy's barbecue at all times. I absolutely loved their brisket and signature sauce, as well as the gas station set up and their self-proclaimed "worst BBQ" marketing. I moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 2010, and while I was there, I was able to experience a Rudy's for the first time since leaving Austin. Sadly, the one in San Antonio wasn't as accessible as the ones in Austin.   Fortunately, I was recently in Phoenix for a weekend and drove past a Rudy's in Chandler. As a lifelong Rudy's fan, I insisted on taking my friend there for breakfast. Unfortunately, my friend wasn't a fan of the sauce, which was a bit too peppery for her taste. But I loved every second of it. The potato, egg and cheese tacos with the sauce were amazing, and I'm still dreaming of that delicious combo.  It was bittersweet to have experienced Rudy's one last time before moving back to Connecticut, but I'm glad I got to end my trip with a bang. I'll definitely miss Rudy's, but it's nice to know there are more locations in the US for when I'm feeling a bit nostalgic for Austin.
62	Do straight marriages hurt anyone? No. Do straight marriages kill many people? No. Are straight marriages going to end the world? No. Are straight marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do gay people get so offensive? If you want marriage to just be between you, fine, but let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to keep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.
63	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way you may perceive a fetus, it is still a living organism that has been created in a very intimate process. It is not your choice to change what nature, God, fate, or whatever has decided for you. If you did not want to get pregnant in the first place, then use protection or abstain from sexual activity.  Unfortunately, some women are victims of rape and must make the difficult decision of whether to keep the child. While this is a difficult position to be in, adoption is an option that should be explored as the child is not responsible for its conception. Therefore, it is unfair to impose the ultimate penalty of death on an innocent life.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish.   In order to catch those fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish - alive fish that we had caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still-living bodies and tossed them in to the water.   I cannot justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered greatly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten.   At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through its own face, fought for its life as I dragged it to the surface, and then removed the hook and started over.   I did not like it. Except… I did.   Fishers, please change my view.
65	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. In comparison, Southwest Florida (Fort Myers, Naples, Cape Coral) appears to lag behind, with an economy largely driven by tourism and little else. This is disheartening, as it means many opportunities for economic growth go untapped. Although tourism is an important economic driver, it should not be the only one. For the love of Pete, let us change our outlook before 2015 so that I have the opportunity to move to Tampa Bay if I have the means.
66	We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there who have been scratching each others' backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate.   Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits. Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System, that is.   The Good Ole' Boys are just biding their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves.   All incumbents should be replaced.
67	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about spaghetti? Quoting the Transformers movies? Karma is spewing out and overflowing and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can't you people have your own thoughts, or is every concept you grasp dependent on it being intermediated by a career actor mouthing lines that have been signed off by a committee of movie company executives? I'm sickened.   Only the first person to tell me "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn" gets an upvote. None thereafter.
68	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us.  Meanwhile, Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  Thus, we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
69	Depending on the state, 18 is the legal age of majority, and parents are no longer obligated to provide financial support for their adult children. In some cases, the custody agreement may specify that support is necessary until the age of 18, but in general, parents are no longer obligated to pay for an 18 year old to live on their own. It sounds like your daughter may need a push in the right direction, and while it may be difficult to watch her self-destruct, it is important to remember that she is an adult and must take responsibility for her actions. You could suggest that she move back in with her father and take responsibility for her own support until she is able to become self-sufficient. If she chooses to stay on her own, she will need to take responsibility for the costs associated with that lifestyle. You could offer her advice, but ultimately, she is an adult and must make her own decisions.
70	I understand the Democratic Party receives the most money from PACs. I understand as a union member that our dues are meagre, and the Teamsters and other unions provide a comparatively small amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I believe unions should be able to fund pro-union politicians as a democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
71	Farquhar should be honoured as the rightful founder of Singapore since he had an integral role in establishing the settlement and playing an important part in its development. He was second-in-command to Thomas Stamford Raffles, who is usually credited as the founder of Singapore, and was involved in helping to develop the infrastructure, administration and government of the settlement.
72	Excuse me! That's quite an aggressive statement. I'm a 17 year old student, recently joined the army reserves and have straight A's. I'm not a retard, which is a very rude thing to say. Retardation is an unfortunate occurrence and there are actual retards out there. I'm also not a lazy fat ass, as I'm very active and athletic. Thank you very much!
73	I believe that professional soccer players should not be able to get away with over-exaggerating injuries so easily. They should be penalized in some way for their pusillanimous behavior. If they are able to brush off minor bumps in other sports, then why do they need to act so dramatically in soccer? It does not give a good image to the sport, and it should not be tolerated. A yellow card is a suitable punishment for such malicious behavior.
74	I believe that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness without fear of legal repercussions as long as they are not causing harm to others. Research has shown that substances such as psilocybin (“shrooms”) and LSD are less harmful than other drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco. They are also not addictive. Given that these drugs are largely harmless and do not appear to have any lasting physical or mental health effects, I believe that they should be legalized.
75	If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a “bad” place, which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street.   What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests.   And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED (ie: innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn't make any sense at all.
76	How do you think we got our freedom by standing back? In the public eye, Iraq does not deserve freedom like ours. We need to keep fighting the terrorists for the people of the world from the terrorists who rule it. And we are not dictators, we are freedom fighters who fight for freedom, justice, and liberty. Unfortunately, people lost sight of it, and voted wrong yesterday. Morally, we are now also headed in the wrong direction. People need to be responsible for their actions and not blame it on science or society. Finally, for the budget, there goes the state and national level budget and economy, and our taxes. People want things to be in place for a better country and community, but who do you think we pay for it in the long run? We do with our taxes, not with the so-called federal and state money people think we have. Country is in a mess, thanks to the ungrateful American public who forget how our free nation was founded and maintained.
77	Definitely, the egg and spoon race is a wicked idea! And maybe we should have the royal family breed up a few more un-privileged little kids to partake in the warfare. Imagine them up against the vodka drinking Russians. I reckon there would be less control over the masses - which has to be a good thing. And there would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world. There'd be little communes, and then gang-ridden cities. But at least all the fighting nobheads would kill themselves in one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it.
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered “unnatural”, but that is between that person and their partner. Love is all some people have in this world, and it is unfair to take that away from them just because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding, not judgement and rejection. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't choose to be gay either. Who would choose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and discriminated against, and cannot be with their loved one. It is unfair and cruel. Respect their rights, and be tolerant and understanding of their differences. God created them that way, after all.
79	It's better to have an imperfect father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father and he won't pry into your business or search your room. He won't be too overbearing and will allow you some independence. He might get angry at your forgetfulness, but he won't put a hole in your backpack or take away your possessions like a truly abusive father would. In some ways, he's still a lousy father, but he's better than being fatherless.
80	CarCraze - You are incorrect in stating that the collection firm does not have the power to amend their notice of motion. As a matter of fact, the collection firm does have that power. Furthermore, their amended notice of motion is a legally binding court order and is equivalent to a subpoena, indicating that you are required to appear in court to answer the motion to collect a debt. If you choose to ignore the order, you may be subject to severe penalties and may be ordered to pay a fine. Therefore, it is in your best interest to seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is satisfactory to your creditor and workable for you. Do not hesitate, as you will surely regret it.
81	I disagree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is a rational thought. One of the primary reasons that these drugs are illegal is because they can cause severe physical harm. It is in the best interest of the government to protect athlete health, as they are too young to understand the irreparable long-term consequences. Additionally, these athletes serve as role models for many young children; do we really want kids to aspire to have high-pitched voices and develop breast tissue by using steroids? If we legalize performance enhancing drugs, we will see an influx in their use in both professional and non-professional athletes. Not only will this threaten the integrity of the sport, but it will also put many athletes at risk of health problems. Therefore, I strongly believe that performance enhancing drugs should remain illegal.
82	Well, the problem is -- until these people have actually been charged with and convicted of a crime, she can't just remove them, absent a supermajority vote of the House.  Improper conduct for a judge may be nothing more than a violation of a judicial ethical rule, and could be something as simple as allowing the appearance of impropriety. It can happen where the judge has never broken the law or even never actually done anything unethical--just the appearance is enough to remove the judge sometimes. But just that appearance is not grounds for forcibly removing an elected official from office. They need to actually have done done something illegal, generally at felony level.  As far as the guy who had cash in his freezer, that's suspicious but not illegal.
83	Here's another thing to think about...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliate, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case seperately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! Scary stuff. This could put our democracy, our justice system and our freedoms at risk.
84	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike, she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain’s old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and the North of England. People I know from these areas absolutely detest her. But recently, to my disbelief, I met a man from London who thought highly of her. He referred to her as “The Iron Lady,” which only infuriates me more. She was a terrible person and did nothing to benefit the people of Britain.
85	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall off beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be that much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Encouraging cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.
86	If you were the dad:  You could always just give extra money that doesn't go through the court's system.   Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.   Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own.  You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own.  Circumstances change throughout life, so this evaluation is in place.  Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job.  It goes by a percentage of his income.
87	All we can say is a big "if" because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows? Maybe in the future India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literate, and more powerful than India, such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation does not yet have enough potential and ability to sustain the needs of its people. India is not yet as full of technologies as those found in the Americas. Well, in fact, technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then". **This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc**, where a minimum wage job refers to an unskilled, menial job that does not require any special skills or training and generally offers no chance of promotion or raise.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider or act on taking their own life, then they also have the strength to choose to continue living. It doesn't make sense why someone would choose to end their own life when they have the power to keep it. Suicide is not a necessary option and those who commit it are stupid. So, the topic is "if you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to live on". I'm open to other views on the topic, please share.
90	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time off work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county’s sheriff’s office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, as well as an application for handgun purchase. In the meantime, you could have bought as many weapons as you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even harder to deal with, such as New York, which has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation. They’re trying to make honest people not want to even have guns—isn't that going too far? Shouldn’t there be a national standard on gun control, or is it up to individual states to create their own laws?
91	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike".    All it accomplishes is:   * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit    * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society    * Reinforce sexist gender roles and expectations    * Make women feel excluded from the values associated with "being a man"   * Invalidate alternative behaviors from both genders    It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to 'act like a lady'). And god forbid that men have some values that women are 'supposed' to have.  Why not have a gender neutral phrase? "Be a better person"?
92	This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas... several kilos of food here for less than £4. If you have a big enough freezer, you can even buy chicken breast in bulk that will last months (£48/10kg here)... Then purchase ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat, but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain that healthy food is expensive).
93	Yeah, it's biased.  But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet search records of Americans over to the Bush administration in the guise of cracking down on porn?  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda.  This can be seen as an attempt to sway the public opinion in favor of the conservative point of view.  Additionally, it has been noted that they are more lenient in allowing controversial questions as long as the user is not offensive in a political way.  This can be seen as an attempt to suppress alternative views and to create an environment that favors the conservative opinion.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. Some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math, science or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be there own unique awesome person, advancing humanity forward in our history. Please consider my argument.
95	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.  In many cases, it could be argued that conservatism is masquerading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything.  On the other hand, pro-choice could be called inconsistent. Just as an individual may believe their life would be better if the foetus didn't exist, the U.S. may feel it more convenient if the nation of Iraq is a bloody mess.  Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
96	Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured, then killed by other cars passing over it.  My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I, however, did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will always be unpleasant, but it is not something that one should show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal; our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another field. I am a wage earner, I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road.   It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and do not have a direct effect on our lives.
97	Three debates in one day criticizing my views on upholding convinceme's seriousness. Convinceme is the ONLY administrator for this website. What he says goes.  If he wants to post rules declaring or dignifying anything, I will follow them.  But he hasn't.  He has left us as a community to make our own decisions.  I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community.  If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it.  I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats.  It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve.  I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions.
98	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will undoubtedly pressure the tribunal to give the death penalty.  But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so quickly. Did you see the glaring eyes and stance when he recently told the judge, "I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner, trying to pass judgment on me"?  The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddam's case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts?   No. The chair will probably decay and break, and the switches/wires will rust or melt away.
