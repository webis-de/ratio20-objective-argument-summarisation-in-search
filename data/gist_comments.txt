The provided information indicates that Snippet B is the best choice in the context of the arguments presented. Snippet B reinforces the idea that the science is settled, highlights the 97% consensus, dispels a common myth about a petition, addresses the fallacy associated with it, and provides additional evidence such as increasing CO2 levels, rising temperatures, glacier mass loss, and human fingerprints linking humans to these events. This makes Snippet B comprehensive and aligned with the scientific consensus on climate change.
Snippet C: It provides a detailed overview of the different types of feminism, identifies the specific movements the speaker aligns with (Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements), and outlines their core principles, emphasizing women's traits and the rejection of dehumanization in pornography.Snippet A: This snippet focuses on the idea that women should make their own activities more visible and valued, and it expresses a clear stance against the dehumanization of women in pornography. However, it lacks the broader context and variety of feminism types mentioned in Snippet C.Snippet B: While this snippet defines feminism as a movement seeking to promote women's rights and liberation, it is more general and lacks the specific details about different feminist movements and their principles, as provided in Snippets A and C.Therefore, the ranking is C, A, B based on the depth and specificity of the information provided about feminism and its various forms.
Snippet A: It provides a concise and straightforward definition of feminism as the advocacy of equal rights and opportunities for women, emphasizing that it is not associated with negative attributes and should not be limited to one gender.Snippet C: This snippet emphasizes that feminism stands up for all perspectives, ambitions, desires, and behaviors, presenting a positive view of feminism. However, it's not as clear and direct as Snippet A.Snippet B: While this snippet discusses activism against woman abuse and negative elements related to women, it introduces terms that may be considered offensive (e.g., "SLuts"). It also lacks the clarity and simplicity of Snippet A.Therefore, the ranking is A, C, B based on clarity, positivity, and avoidance of potentially offensive language.
Ranking the snippets based on the provided information:  1. Snippet C: It provides a clear and concise statement about feminism being the movement for equality between men and women. It also effectively counters Con's arguments by pointing out the lack of evidence for the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings.  2. Snippet B: This snippet points out a lack of evidence for Con's claim about words with similar roots and effectively concludes that Con is also for feminism. However, it's not as focused and direct as Snippet C.  3. Snippet A: While it presents the argument against Con's position, it's more detailed and might be considered less straightforward compared to Snippets B and C. It discusses Con's arguments in detail but may not be as immediately clear.  Therefore, the ranking is C, B, A based on clarity, conciseness, and effectiveness in countering Con's arguments.
1. Snippet C: This snippet provides a concise and clear definition of feminism, emphasizing equality and respect for both men and women.  2. Snippet A: While it effectively communicates the definition of feminism and addresses misconceptions, the use of language like "I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish" might be perceived as confrontational.  3. Snippet B: This snippet starts well but is cut off, leaving it incomplete. It seems to counter the claim about feminism encouraging false rape accusations, but the incomplete sentence makes it less effective.  Overall, Snippet C is ranked highest for its clarity and positive tone, while Snippet A and Snippet B are comparable but have slight differences in tone and completeness.
1. Snippet C: This snippet provides a clear and concise argument in favor of feminism, emphasizing its importance in addressing global gender inequality. It acknowledges success in some first-world countries but highlights the ongoing need for feminism in other parts of the world.  2. Snippet B: This snippet critiques the opponent's argument for focusing solely on feminism in the United States and acknowledges the lack of parameters in the debate. However, it appears to be incomplete as it ends abruptly with a note of thanks to the readers.  Snippet A is not provided for comparison. 
1. Snippet A: This snippet introduces the abortion debate, outlining the two opposing sides. It succinctly presents the pro-choice stance advocating for a woman's right to choose and the pro-life perspective opposing abortion due to the termination of potential life.  2. Snippet B: This snippet provides a medical definition of abortion and expresses a personal stance against certain forms of abortion for health reasons. It touches on the dangers associated with unsafe abortion methods, emphasizing the immorality of harmful actions.  3. Snippet C: This snippet appears to be part of a larger argument or debate, indicating a willingness to counter an opposing case. However, it lacks specific content related to the abortion topic, making it less informative than the other snippets.  
In summary, Snippet A is ranked highest for its clear emphasis on the necessity of abortion to control population growth and its potential impact on women's mental health. Snippet C also emphasizes these points but is slightly less detailed. Snippet B, while presenting population estimates, is less comprehensive in discussing the broader consequences.
The first snippet condenses the argument very succinctly and covers most of the major points in the arguments above.   The second snippet is ranked second because it condenses what feminism is and what it is not - which is the primary point in the argument above.  Snippet 3 is ranked third because it is incomplete and doesn't make much sense on its own.
Rank 1. Covers many major points.  Rank 2. Covers the main point.  Rank 3. Only quoted mother Teresa. 
Snippet 1 - covers important points but leaves out one main point.  Snippet 2 - Incomplete Snippet 3 - covers all major aspects of the argument
If I could have,  I would have ranked both Snippets 1 and 2 on rank 3. Both are equally unclear and beat around the bush. 
Sinppet A - best Snippet B - Inconclusive.  Snippet C - Misses many points but still covers the major point. 
Snippet B - least effective
Snippet B - misses the central issue
Snippet B and A are exactly the same. 
Snippet C - best Snippet A - lacks focus on the main thing Snippet B - unclear
Snippet C - has no substance
Snippet - too narrow in focus
Snippet c - too narrow
Snippet c - just focuses on one narrow cost related aspect 
Snippet B - very direct and to the point Snippet C - least direct
Snippet A and C are equally bad. 
Snippet b and c - equally pointless
Snippet b - cannot be made out from the above provided argument 
In snippet c, the word CO2 at the end should be left out. The argument itself is a bit garbled, it start with two but than doesnt follow up with the "first" with "second" and doesnt seem coherent in general.
None of this makes sense
Oh my goodness!   
Snippet b - lacks focus Snippet c - lacks overall summary
there is a typing error in the 11th line of the para where the word and instead of any has been used
Snippet A and Snippet B are equally good/bad, given that their structure is almost identical. The reason why Snippet B is ranked second is because is starts with a clear statement of fact (no comma afterwards), which can earn the attention of the reader a bit better. Snippet C needs an end of sentence, but it manages to point out the 3 main points made in the paragraph, which is why it is ranked 1st. 
The argument is trying to deliver 2 main messages: A. the fact that that climate change is not really up for debate, as there is a scientific consensus and B. humans are the root cause of most climate issues. The only snippet that successfully encompasses that is Snippet C ( starts with  a clear statement and follows up with a clear cause). Snippet A has a clear statement, but it follows up with examples of climate issues, without managing to bring the discussion back to how climate change is caused by humans (this will lose the reader, as the link is not made back to him - e.g. you should read this article, as this article shows why and how humans are the root cause of climate change). Snippet B has a really poor sentence topic. Besides that, it is very unclear who the deniers are and what the actual conclusion of your article is. Overall, it is a bit messy and unclear what the message is.
Snippet C does the best job when it comes to summarizing the argument above. It has a clear statement of fact and proceeds with pointing out the main view of the author. I feel like Snippet A and B are equally bad at delivering the message of the argument, but what Snippet A does slightly better than Snippet B is that it starts with the conclusion of the argument, which always helps the reader/the interlocutor grasp the final point a bit better (as they know what to expect from the argument, so it is easier for them to actually follow it). 
Despite ending a bit abruptly, Snippet B does the best job of summarizing what the author of the argument is trying to claim. The main point of the argument, ultimately, is that feminism should stand against all activities that might harm the image of women and Snippet B manages to deliver the point. Snippet A is very vague and could easily be the summary of another argument completely - it doesn't manage to make the link back to the argument. Snippet C seems to be the most irrelevant snippet for the argument presented, as it starts with a statement about the authors' own values, without even vaguely pointing out what those are. It follows up with another vague definition of feminism as the act of advocating, without managing to send an actual message across. 
Snippet B is the worst summary for the argument presented above because there is not direct link between the statement and the conclusion of the snippet - so it completely misses the point. Snippet A is unclear as well, as it enumerates a couple of aspects presented in the argument, but doesn't manage to link them together in a logical manner. It is better than snippet B for the sole reason that it gives the reader a slight idea of what is to come in the argument. While snippet C is not perfect, it does the best job of delivering the main message of the passage - that being - why the author thinks Con has failed to substantiate his argument. 
No option carriers the “argument” of hypocrisy
same one as the last, first and second snippet contains text not found in the argument
If I were to advice, snippet A should be a little bit shorter, as sometimes longer claims tend to not reach the reader/consumer. However, Snippet A is the only snippet that manages to deliver the actual content of the paragraph, as the paragraph focuses heavily on rape culture and what that entails, especially in connection with the feminism movement. I would also not keep the personal attack towards the interlocutor ("downright childish"), as it takes away from the actual message of the paragraph. Snippet C is clear, but it is a big vague and it doesn't manage to summarise the point made in the argument. If you were to click on snippet C, you wouldn't necessarily expect to read about the intricacies of rape culture, but much rather about the feminism movement as a whole (definitions, waves, etc.). Snippet B is unclear, does not have a a good sentence structure and does not summarise the paragraph in the slightest. 
the structure of these snippets is similar to what i have previously given to read. a lot of my feedback still applies. However, Snippet A and C are very similar in value in this case. 
Snippet C is by far the best snippet in this sequence. It has a clear structure and it delivers the message of the paragraph. Snippet A and B both have grammatical errors (need/needed), which would discredit the link/argument/page from the get go. Besides that, they do not manage to summarise the argument. It seems like they are snippets of text taken directly out of the main paragraph, without much editing. They have no beginning and no end.
Snippet C is clear and to the point, does a great job at summarising the argument above. Snippet A can be interesting as the title of this argument on a results page, as it highlights important statements made by the author in the paragraph. This can easily portray to the reader where the argument is going and what they can expect from it. 
Snippet A is not by any means a good summary, but it is the best of the three, as it manages to point out some arguments made by the author of the paragraph. It manages to send across the message of the author, even if it does so in an unclear manner. Snippet B seems to be clear and to the point, but it does not summarise the main paragraph at all. If someone clicks on snippet B, they will be taken by surprise by the quite colourful stance of the author. Snippet C is simply a quote from the text which is not particularly relevant to the core of the arguments made. Also, it does not have a clear end. 
Snippet A is ranked 3rd because there is no logical link between the first part of the snippet and the second part of the snippet. No reader could understand what the argument is about from that summary alone. Snippet C is to the point and it is the only one with a clear beginning and a clear end. 
The argument made is simple - the author does not believe in abortion. Snippet B would be a good choice for a "click-bait" summary, as it benefits from strong rhetoric. It also manages to deliver the summary of the argument which is - "the author believes abortion is bad". Snippet C is also a good summary of the paragraph, but it lacks the impact of Snippet B. 
None of the Snippets manage to entirely summarise the content of the paragraph. Snippet C and B are very similar in content and structure, so both of them can be used. 
Snippet A is an inaccurate summary of the paragraph, given that at no point in time is there an argument seen or presented for the other side. The paragraph does not talk about the different opinions of society on this subject, but much rather focuses on types of abortions, followed up by an unclear analogy. Snippet B is long, unfinished and unclear. 
No snippet manages to bring about a good summary of the paragraph. However, Snippet B is the only one that at least manages to reproduce a part of the points made by the author. From my point of view, Snippet A and C are equally bad and irrelevant to the arguments presented above. 
Snippet C is a very good snippet. It is clear, concise and summarises the argument made above quite well. Snippet B summarises the argument well, but it is unfinished. Snippet A does not manage to highlight the argument made in the paragraph above, as it does not have a clear structure and the reader can get easily lost. 
None of the snippets provide an actual summary of the text. Besides that, only snippet C is complete and grammatically correct. However, it also misses the point of the paragraph completely. I would not use any of the snippets above. 
Only snippet B is relevant for the above paragraph. 
I feel like Snippet B is better than A because it manages to summarise the argument in a very concise manner. Snippet A does a good job as well, but it is harder to follow. 
I chose Snippet A over Snippet B as I feel it has more of an impact, but snippet B is also a good, concise summary of the text.
No snippet is particularly accurate, as they do not manage to summarise the argument made by the author - which ultimately is that there is a lot of propaganda against Trump and that changing your views on political issues is completely normal, even sometimes smart. 
Snippet C comes in last because it is completely inaccurate, given that it claims these points of view are Trump's points of view. In fact, they are the views of the narrator/author. 
Hard to follow what this is about
These snippets are all not very adequate
