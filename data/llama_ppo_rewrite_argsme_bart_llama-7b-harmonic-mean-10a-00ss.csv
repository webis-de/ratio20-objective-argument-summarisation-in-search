0	Climate change is an urgent issue that requires our attention, as the impacts of global warming are becoming more and more evident.
1	There is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Human-induced climate change has already caused numerous deaths due to extreme weather events and health conditions exacerbated by heat waves. According to the World Health Organization, climate change is estimated to claim over 150,000 lives annually. Diseases caused by climate fluctuations are becoming more common, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heat waves.
2	My position on climate change is that I believe it is occurring and is caused in part by human activities.
3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is primarily caused by human activities. The potential risks to children in connection with climate change are so serious that traditional measures of combatting bad speech may not be adequate or sufficient. Teenagers may be especially affected by the adverse effects of climate change, as they may be more vulnerable to the risks associated with it due to their age.
4	Given the amount of evidence indicating that climate change is occurring, it is likely that human activities are contributing to it. While this phenomenon is still debated among scientists, the consensus is that climate change is occurring and caused in part by human activities.
5	The climate is definitely changing, and this has been clearly demonstrated by climate change research. While local weather patterns may vary, the overall trend is towards a changing global climate. This is a naturally occurring phenomenon and is not caused by any specific individual or organization. It is important to heed the warnings of climate scientists and take proactive steps to mitigate the effects of climate change.
6	Climate change is a significant global threat which is caused by the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activity. This has led to an increase in global temperatures, with more extreme events such as droughts and floods becoming more frequent. This can be seen in the rise of CO2 levels since the mid-20th century, correlated with increased human industrial activity. In addition, global temperatures have risen by around 1C since 1969, while ocean temperatures have risen significantly as well.
7	There is evidence to suggest that climate change may be caused by human activity, in addition to natural factors. While it is impossible to accurately predict the impact of human activity on climate change, it is possible that it could have a significant effect. The laws of physics and mathematics do suggest that a small increase in temperature could be caused by human activity.
8	The earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including carbon dioxide. According to the IPCC, emissions of carbon dioxide from natural and man-made sources amounts to around 8-9 gigatons per year. This is a significant contribution to global warming and climate change, so it is essential to consider both natural and man-made influences when studying the issue. While scientists are motivated by funding just as any other profession, it is important to consider both sides of the argument when making decisions about policy and solutions.
9	There is a high degree of consensus among climate experts that climate change is occurring, with the burning of fossil fuels being a key factor.
10	There are many different types of feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. These movements advocate for equality between men and women, recognizing that both genders can possess different traits and qualities. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women can also seek to improve themselves without necessarily having to compete with them.
11	Feminism is a movement that seeks to establish political, economic, and social equality between men and women.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. While it is true that dictionaries do not provide an exclusive or definitive definition of words, they can provide a meaning that is widely accepted and commonly used.
13	Feminism is the advocacy for gender equality between men and women. In some instances, this can lead to accusations of false rape being taken more seriously than in the past as an attempt to reduce the gender imbalance in such cases. This is not an ideal situation and can be difficult for all parties involved. However, this is a necessary step towards gender equality and I believe that feminists are working towards this goal.
14	My opponent argues that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I understand the terms of the debate and accepted it, I believe that feminism is an important movement that seeks to achieve equality between the sexes. Although progress has been made in some areas, gender inequality still exists, and feminism will remain important in order to ensure long-term success. Moreover, feminism will continue to be instrumental in maintaining equality and spreading this important ideology. Sources are crucial to demonstrate the need for feminism to continue, as well as its successes to date.
15	I agree that feminism is needed in countries where women are marginalized and have limited rights. While first world countries like the US may have achieved greater gender equality, this process is often incomplete in certain regions due to cultural and religious factors. This is an important reminder that feminism must take into account the local context, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach.
16	I understand your definition of feminism, however, I believe that third wave feminism has provided a newer and updated perspective on gender equality. Therefore, I believe that women’s rights have continued to evolve and improve over time. While the Declaration of Independence was written a few centuries ago, women’s rights have certainly advanced since then. I believe that modern feminism has been successful in providing more equal opportunities for women.
17	I believe that men and women should both strive for equality, and this should not be exclusive to one particular movement. Feminism is an important movement which campaigns for issues that specifically affect women, however it is important that both men and women work together to address issues affecting both genders. Although feminism does not have a monopoly on equality, both men and women should be involved in campaigns that target issues that affect their gender.
18	Pro admitted they are pro equal rights, which is supported by feminism. Feminism seeks to ensure that everyone is given the same opportunities and treated fairly, regardless of gender. This can be beneficial to women as it can provide them with more equal access to resources and opportunities.   In addition, feminism does not have to come at the expense of men.
19	Feminism today has become increasingly complex and can be seen from multiple perspectives. I believe that both men and women should be granted equal rights, and that this should not only be limited to women but also extended to men.
20	Abortion is a difficult decision for women to make, as it involves terminating a pregnancy. According to estimates, over 42 million women around the world choose to terminate their pregnancies. While abortion carries risks, it is a safe and legal option in many countries, and laws in some jurisdictions protect the reproductive rights of women.
21	Abortion is the premature removal of a fetus and its accompanying membranes and placenta from the uterus. I am against many forms of abortion due to the risks associated with the procedure, which can be significant. While some women may opt for medical or surgical abortion, these procedures should only be undertaken in a safe, clinical setting with the proper medical attention.
22	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, either by removing or expelling the fetus or embryo from the uterus, resulting in or caused by its death. This can occur naturally in some cases, but is most commonly induced in order to ensure the safety of the mother and ensure a successful pregnancy outcome. In the context of human pregnancies, this can be an important and necessary choice.
23	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, either medically induced or chemically induced, which results in the death of the fetus or embryo. This can occur due to complications during pregnancy or be done intentionally to protect the mother's health. In the case of human pregnancies, this procedure can be done in order to ensure the mother's safety.
24	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, either spontaneously or through intervention, in which the fetus or embryo is removed from the uterus, resulting in the death of the fetus or embryo. It is a difficult decision to make and can be done for various reasons, including preserving the health of the mother. While it is an emotive topic, it is important to have access to safe and legal abortion procedures that are appropriate for each individual situation.
25	Abortion is needed to control the population and avoid overpopulation. If abortion were illegal, women would be forced to turn to unsafe and illegal methods to terminate their pregnancy, increasing the risk for both mother and baby.
26	I thank my opponent for their response to my previous argument. Abortion is generally seen as a contentious topic, with differing views on both the morality and legality of the procedure. It is important to consider both the physical and mental wellbeing of the mother, as well as the availability of resources, when making the decision. Ultimately, this is a highly individual decision which should be made by the person closest to the situation.   It is important to consider both the personal and societal impacts of any decision made. While shaving is a personal choice, it may not always be the best choice for all people in all situations. As such, it is essential to consider all the available options before making a decision.
27	"Con" would agree that abortion should be legal as it can provide women with more autonomy over their bodies and lives. If abortion were to be made illegal, it would likely lead to more unsafe abortions, which can endanger both the woman and the foetus. Therefore, it is important to keep access to safe and legal abortions available in order to reduce the risk.
28	Making abortion illegal can be controversial as some people may do so out of a desire to restrict access to the procedure.
29	This is an important debate about how abortion should be viewed morally. While opinions on the subject may be firm, it is important to consider both sides and come to an individual decision.
30	Life is the ability to grow, change and reproduce over time which sets apart plants and animals from non-living things. This growth and change is influenced by the organism's metabolism which allows it to regulate the balance of its internal structures and also to acquire, use and store energy.
31	Donald Trump’s racist rhetoric and policies have been particularly pervasive and damaging, as they pose a significant threat to civil rights and have a detrimental effect on many individuals and communities. Research has shown that racism can have serious health and economic implications, as it can lead to poor physical and mental health, reduced productivity, and reduced life expectancy. This can lead to social exclusion and further entrench disadvantage.
32	"I believe I can create more jobs for Americans than any other president in history. I will work to bring jobs back to the US from overseas, which will help to create more jobs for Americans and bring the American dream back. If elected, I will work to make America great again.
33	Trump's comments and policies have caused much controversy. While his approach may be attention-grabbing, it can be difficult to accurately judge his intentions.
34	Ranchers in Arizona have long been known to hunt down and apprehend unauthorized immigrants. They have used dogs, guns, and other means to protect the US border. This practice has been inspired by some Republicans, such as Pat Buchanan, who argue that immediate action is necessary to preserve the US as a predominantly white, Christian-European nation. Given the potential for such groups to form under a Trump administration, it is important to consider the risks involved and vote accordingly.
35	In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he suggested that the government could partner with hospitals to provide healthcare to low-income Americans. In early 2015, he proposed a healthcare plan that would increase competition and choice while reducing costs for Americans. Today, his plan confirms that he supports a free market system to deliver healthcare, while ensuring that Americans have access to affordable care. While his views have evolved over the years, he still believes in the need for a market-based system to ensure quality care for all Americans. While no single healthcare system can perfectly align with the teachings of the Bible, Trump seeks to balance cost, choice, and access while still allowing for a free market system.
36	Trump is undeniably a skilled negotiator, and despite his controversial remarks in the past, he is able to successfully navigate delicate agreements. Trump is able to express his opinion without fear of consequence, which can be beneficial when dealing with complicated matters.
37	A card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card of a different suit could potentially prove more powerful in certain instances, as certain suits have different strengths and weaknesses that can be
38	"WashPo's list is full of clearly false statements. It is likely that some of the statements on the list are untrue, as no President is likely to make as many false claims as Trump.
39	Hillary Clinton called Trump a racist, which he denied. Clinton likely sought to raise these accusations in order to gain support among Democratic voters. Trump asserted that Clinton was desperate and trying to revive discussion on these issues as she lagged behind in the primary race. He stated that he was honored that Clinton had focused on him rather than Jeb Bush, implying that Clinton had acted out of desperation to maintain her lead.
40	"I understand the desire for the United Kingdom to have more control over its own laws and policy decisions, and I recognize the impact that Brexit could have on both the UK and the EU", he says. "While I recognize the will of the British people, I am also mindful of the complexities of the situation, and believe that a negotiated exit may be the best course of action.
41	Leaving the EU would not have a significant impact on Britain's economy, as the 6.3 billion pounds spent on EU membership only accounts for 0.3% of GDP. In addition, the UK is able to set its own immigration policies independently, meaning leaving the EU would have little effect in this area.   Moreover, it is important to consider the wider impact of Brexit on Britain’s economy.
42	Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU, and while being part of the European Union does have its benefits, each country maintains its own independence and is able to run its own affairs in accordance with its own laws and regulations.
43	England has had great success outside of the EU, as seen with Switzerland and Norway. Not every country needs to be part of a large, overarching EU, as Yugoslavia’s break-up in the 1990s illustrates. Although borders can be difficult to negotiate, having open ones can be beneficial to ensure the free movement of citizens and goods. This allows for more economic and cultural exchanges, as seen with Panama and Colombia. Without the need to continually pay large sums of money to the EU, the UK would be better off financially. Although Romania and Bulgaria pay nothing, the UK will still have to contribute due to the agreement already in place. In the end, the UK is likely to benefit from leaving the EU. This is the opinion of many, with a majority wanting to leave.
44	I was not at all implying that Britain should adopt a different model for regulating immigration and refugees. I was in no way implying that we should ‘go it alone’ and leave the European Union. Brexit provides the opportunity for Britain to have an independent voice in the decisions that affect our borders, whilst still being able to work collaboratively with other EU countries. This offers us the best of both worlds, and gives us the ability to adapt our policies depending on the needs of the British people.  Times have certainly changed, and it is important to consider how the economies of other EU countries have been affected by the changes in the Union. It is clear that Brexit offers Britain more control and flexibility in its policy decisions.
45	My opponent may be correct in stating that sources should be used, but it is important to cite the sources accurately by using quotation marks and providing the relevant references. Failing to do so can still lead to plagiarism, regardless of the source being used. Thus, it is vital to ensure accuracy when using sources in order to avoid any plagiarism risks.
46	The people of the UK face various challenges due to Brexit, including the migration of workers from the EU into the country. This has had a negative effect on the jobs market, leading to fewer opportunities for UK citizens and higher living costs.
47	Britain has been an active member of the EU for a number of years and it is important to consider both the benefits and drawbacks of the Union. It is important to have a trial period in order to understand the implications of leaving the EU and assess the potential impacts on our cooperation on global security. While the EU may provide valuable resources in this area, it is also important to consider the contributions of non-EU countries such as America, Canada, and Australia which can provide valuable information on potential terrorist threats. This shows that neither unilateral action nor EU membership provides the full solution to this complex issue, and that further exploration is necessary.
48	I believe that a more independent UK is beneficial in the long run and that the government will be able to make well-considered decisions for their future as an independent nation. This has been demonstrated by past examples, which have shown that independence allows for greater self-sufficiency. While this is an interesting topic, I understand that it is difficult to provide more evidence to back up my opinion. I appreciate the discussion and the knowledge that has been shared.
49	In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row in the United States. In California, the cost of maintaining a death penalty system is estimated to be around $11.5 million per year compared to a system without the death penalty, which would cost approximately $137 million annually. Studies have shown that states without the death penalty have lower crime rates, suggesting that the death penalty is not necessarily a deterrent for crime.   From a personal perspective, while it is understandable that those convicted of serious crimes should be punished, spending the rest of one’s life in a six-foot by six-foot box, reflecting on the crime and the consequences of one’s actions, could be more traumatic than dying.
50	The death penalty carries the risk of wrongly convicting innocent individuals, as the government can make mistakes. In some cases, the person may have already been executed by the time the mistake is realised. This can lead to great injustices and is unacceptable. Additionally, while life in prison without parole may be more expensive upfront, it is more cost effective in the long run as it eliminates the risk of wrongful execution. This makes life in prison without parole a more cost-effective form of punishment.
51	The death penalty has been proven to reduce crime in some states such as Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. This can be attributed to the increase in executions as crime rates drop. Removing the death penalty could have negative effects, as it may be difficult to replace the deterrent effect it has in certain areas. It is clear that the death penalty can be a useful tool in helping to reduce crime and it is important to consider this when making policy decisions.   The death penalty can also be seen as morally justified and cost-efficient. While DNA testing can increase the accuracy of identifying offenders, it can also lead to the wrongful execution of innocent people. This risk is a factor to consider when deciding whether to implement the death penalty as it can lead to serious errors in cases.
52	The death penalty serves an important purpose in providing justice to the families of the victims as well as providing a deterrent to potential criminals. While the death penalty may not be suitable for every case, it can still be an effective form of punishment in certain circumstances. Capital punishment has been shown to reduce crime rates and thus plays an important role in maintaining order and security in society.
53	The death penalty has been shown to act as a deterrent, as it removes the threat of the criminal committing further crimes. This can be seen by looking at the link provided, which documents the homicide rate per 100,000 population for the years 1950-2002. This shows a steady decline in crime rates in the years after executions took place, indicating that the death penalty serves as a deterrent to crime.
54	The death penalty can be expensive due to the resources necessary to carry out the sentence. It is important to consider both the initial costs of capital punishment, as well as the long-term costs associated with keeping a criminal incarcerated. These costs can vary significantly, so it is important to look at both the short-term and long-term costs when evaluating the financial implications of the death penalty.
55	The death penalty implies that a jury of twelve people is qualified to take life into their own hands.
56	Death penalty cases generate roughly $470,000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense. On direct appeal, the cost of appellate defense averages $100,000 more in death penalty cases, than in non-death penalty murder cases. Personal restraint petitions filed in death penalty cases on average cost an additional $137,000. If the death penalty were not utilized, it would be possible to seek alternative sentences which could provide these offenders with the chance to prove that the death sentence is too irreversible.
57	I believe that the death penalty is necessary to truly provide justice in some cases. From a moral standpoint, it makes sense that a serial killer should face the ultimate punishment for their multiple crimes. In order to maintain public trust in the justice system, it is important to have the death penalty as an option. While its effectiveness is difficult to gauge, it still provides a sense of justice being served.   In some countries, prisoners are sent to 5-star hotels which can create an issue as it may be difficult to ensure equal punishments. Therefore, I believe the death penalty should be an option in certain cases in order to provide a fair and just punishment.
58	The death penalty does not give the accused any hope of rehabilitation and is often sought after by families of the victims in order to gain closure. Although this method of execution is not ideal as it carries a risk of innocent people being wrongfully executed, it is still a suitable option in certain cases. In order to ensure a higher degree of accuracy and minimize any potential mistakes, it is essential to use alternative methods which ensure a greater degree of certainty. As such, death penalty should be avoided in favor of more humane methods as they offer a more reliable outcome.
59	Google is releasing several new products, such as Google Classroom and self-driving cars. While this could lead to a more internet-dependent world, it could also have many advantages.
60	"Google receives around 188 million visitors per day, while Bing receives around 60 million visitors per day. This suggests that Google is more popular than Bing, as it is able to draw in significantly more traffic.
61	Google is a reliable source, so "pro must win" Con searches prove that Google can be reliable, as it provides accurate and useful information in many cases.
62	My opponent has failed to refute any points that I have made, and has not provided any evidence to counter my argument.
63	Bing deserves more recognition as it offers a number of features and benefits that are often overshadowed by Google. While some may be biased towards Google due to their familiarity with it, this does not reflect the full picture as those who prefer Google often neglect the differences that Bing has to offer.
64	Google is protecting its market position, which is crucial for its long-term success. This is a natural part of business which is why we often see monopolies and duopolies in the real world.
65	Is any company paying Google for result slots? This can be beneficial for businesses as they can increase their visibility and reach more customers.
66	There is still a level of learning that needs to take place in order to use Google Glass effectively and safely, as well as a need to ensure that it is properly tested and monitored.
67	"Is the Google Review Rating System good or bad? "  I believe that this system can be beneficial as it allows customers to provide direct feedback about their experiences, Allowing businesses to identify areas that need improvement and increase customer satisfaction. Additionally, It can help to improve search engine results as reviews are taken into account when determining a site’s ranking. Therefore, I believe that this system can be a positive influence on the overall experience.
68	Google+ is a free account that does no harm to you. The high character limit of up to 10,000 allows users to write out their entire comment in one go, which can be very beneficial in informal debates when more characters are needed to successfully argue your case. This can be especially useful when trying to convey complex ideas or provide detailed explanations.
69	"To go vegan and stop the murder of these animals would not only counter the effects of our evolution" Although going vegan may not be possible for everyone, it is important to consider the impacts that animal agriculture has on both the environment and animal welfare. Companies can and do change their ingredients to make vegan alternatives which can provide equal or better taste and quality. "Plus, steak and bacon are amazing." I agree that vegan alternatives can be great, however it is important to remember that not all vegan alternatives are created equally. It is important to consider the ingredients and how they affect both our health and the environment. It may be beneficial to source vegan alternatives from companies which prioritize sustainability and animal welfare.
70	Veganism is the practice of abstaining from animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy which advocates for the respect and consideration of all sentient beings. This ethos is motivated by the understanding that animals should not be exploited for human gain, regardless of whether or not they provide direct economic benefit. Vegans strive to reduce animal suffering and avoid exploitation wherever possible.
71	Going vegan is beneficial for the majority of adults as it can provide essential nutrients, requires less land and provides more food for those in need. Additionally, animals are sentient and capable of feeling emotions like happiness and unhappiness, meaning they should be treated with respect and compassion. Therefore, going vegan could provide numerous benefits for the world.
72	In many countries, including America, the majority of the population consume animal-based products such as meat. Transitioning from animal-based products to plant-based alternatives such as soy can provide various advantages for both producers and consumers.
73	Lacto-ovo vegetarianism is a diet that excludes meat, fish, and poultry, but includes dairy products and eggs. Hippopotamuses are classified as either ovo-vegetarians or lacto-vegetarians, as they are unable to obtain sufficient nutrients from an all-plant diet. Camels and cattle are ovo-vegetarians, as they are more closely related to other animals that require animal products for nutrition.
74	Meat eaters are not necessarily aware of the environmental impacts of their choices. We take advantage of the Earth’s resources for our own gain and pleasure, whether that be through harvesting trees, contaminating water sources, or over-exploiting land. We have to recognise that our current meat production has a significant environmental footprint and needs to be addressed, as well as finding alternative solutions that balance our desires with the needs of the planet.
75	I believe that the welfare of animals should be taken into consideration when making food choices. Eating animal-based products can have an impact on the animals' living conditions and their environment, so I believe it is important to consider both sides when deciding what to eat. While animals may suffer under poor conditions, plant-based products can provide an alternative that does not require the use of animals.   I understand that many factors need to be considered when making food choices, including convenience and taste. I believe that it is possible to make a conscious decision that takes into account both the short-term and long-term impacts of one's diet.
76	Many women today are more open-minded and willing to indulge in sexual activities with their partners. Some women may be more hesitant and prefer to wait until after marriage, but others are comfortable with sharing the experience.
77	I dispute my opponent's claim that love ice cream is not a commodity. When a man shares his milk with his partner, the lady often enjoys the experience just as much as he does. Vegans may choose to abstain from animal products for ethical reasons, but this does not mean that they are not able to enjoy the flavors of non-vegan dishes. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, so vegan women may be more likely to enjoy some non-vegan dishes than other vegans. This does not make them hypocrites as it depends on the individual's preferences.
78	You use the term “animals” as though all animals are omnivores, which is not necessarily the case. In fact, many animals are actually herbivores, such as certain species of deer, antelope, and gazelles which primarily consume leaves and grasses.
79	Nuclear power plants can be a very efficient source of energy, as they can produce more energy than other sources with less environmental impact. Nuclear energy produces far less carbon emissions than other forms of energy, as 95% of the energy is generated without carbon dioxide. While the risks of nuclear energy are undoubtedly serious, modern safety measures and advances in technology have made nuclear energy much safer. We should still be mindful of the risks, but it is also important to recognize the potential benefits that nuclear energy can offer.
80	There is no doubt that nuclear energy works. We have yet to discover a feasible way to safely dispose of the radioactive waste without further endangering lives and ecology. Renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydro, and solar, are indeed efficient, affordable, and cleaner than nuclear. As these sources mature, they all have the potential to provide great benefits to the world. Magnetic energy has the potential to become a valuable source of energy in the future.
81	Nuclear power is an efficient and cost-effective source of energy. Its advantages include low operating costs, low emissions, and relatively low waste production. In addition, the economic benefits of nuclear energy can be considerable and may outweigh those of other forms of energy.
82	I believe we should continue to rely on nuclear energy as a transitional solution until we have more sustainable alternatives. A new material, thorium, becomes safe after 100 years, which gives us time to develop reusable energy technology. To tackle the volcano issue, we can put a nuclear waste storage facility in an area with a stable tectonic plate, as technology improvements will likely drive up costs.   Investing in nuclear energy now can help us transition to a more sustainable energy future, and allow us to realize its many benefits in the short term.
83	We should not use more nuclear energy as it brings several drawbacks. Firstly, nuclear waste is difficult to dispose of as it can be hazardous to the environment and cause long-term damage. Additionally, the cost of generating nuclear energy is high and it relies heavily on a consistent source of uranium, making it more dependent on one resource. Finally, nuclear accidents can have serious consequences, as seen in the past.   Solar energy has several advantages over nuclear power. Solar farms can often be built with the same cost as nuclear power but with less risk. Solar energy is renewable, clean, and widely available, making it a better option for power generation.
84	I will first defend my arguments and then attack what my opponent has said. My opponent is correct that nuclear accidents can be costly and have caused devastation in the past. The Japanese incident provides a strong example of this, as well as Hurricane Sandy which caused damage at a few nuclear power plants in the US.   However, this does not necessarily mean that nuclear power plants are not viable options. While the cost of building a single plant can be high, the economic benefits of multiple plants commissioned simultaneously can offset this. This is due to the economies of scale that can be achieved. Furthermore, the cost of nuclear energy is still more affordable than alternative energy sources in the long term.
85	Nuclear energy offers many benefits and can be an economical choice for power production as it can provide cost savings over time due to its low fuel costs. It does not add to the environmental risks associated with other power sources and can be an effective and reliable source of energy.
86	In this round, my opponent misinterpreted my argument, likely due to a lack of knowledge or understanding of the technology. It is true that solar energy has been proven effective for years and is a viable alternative energy source in many cases.
87	My opponent needs to look back to my round 2 where I proved carbon is released in earlier stages. This is a problem as it will result in higher levels of carbon emissions by 2050 compared to other sources of energy. This means that the overall balance of carbon emissions may shift towards nuclear energy. Therefore, it is important to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy in regards to carbon emissions.
88	We are quickly running out of oil and other traditional energy sources, so it is important to develop new sources of energy. Wind power is a great option as it is widely available and can provide an adequate source of energy. However, to power a city like New York, it would likely require a large number of wind turbines, so it is important to look at other options as well. Nuclear energy is a possible solution, as it is efficient and available in many parts of the world. While it is a good option, it may become scarce in the future as fuel supplies are depleted. It is important for all of us to take action and help transition to new energy sources in order to meet our energy needs.
89	There have been several articles posted on the internet that suggest that Donald Trump may not be as conservative as he claims to be. Some argue that he could be a "spoiler" taking votes away from other Republican candidates. This can be difficult for voters to decipher as only time will tell whether Trump truly believes in what he is saying. It is encouraging for voters to see a presidential candidate aligning themselves with their beliefs, providing hope that Trump's rhetoric is genuine.  It is important to consider the authenticity of his positions as well as his ability to effectively implement them if elected.
90	Donald Trump has certain qualities that make him a risky choice for president. In his last debate, he stated that he would act unilaterally as necessary without further clarification, which could lead to dangerous decisions.
91	Donald Trump has no prior experience in politics, and this raises some concerns as to whether he is the best fit for the job. Although he may have some strong views and ideas on how to implement change, it is difficult to predict how this will ultimately play out. It is important to keep in mind that Trump may not have all the details worked out in his plan, which could lead to unexpected consequences. This highlights the importance of having a detailed understanding of how policy changes could affect not just the US, but other countries as well.
92	Donald Trump has limited political experience and has expressed views that are concerning in some respects. While he has not been fully specific on how he plans to replace Obamacare, he has stated that he wishes to replace it with something that will provide better coverage while lowering costs. When it comes to international trade, it is important to consider the potential impacts of policy changes and how they may affect jobs in the US.
93	The Republican Party is a long-standing political party in the United States that has traditionally favored limited government and smaller taxes. President Donald Trump was elected into office with a mission to dismantle inefficient government policies and replace them with his own ideas. His goals aim to provide a more efficient and effective government. While his methods may be unconventional, they are aimed at achieving the same goal as the Republican Party - a government that is more effective and accountable to the people.
94	Donald Trump has been accused of being racist due to his comments about certain racial groups, which suggest that he perceives them as lazier and less hardworking than others. He has also been accused of being a liar for claiming that he is the "least racist person".
95	I did not specify that I was talking about Donald Trump, the current President of the United States.
96	A President is elected to lead all citizens of the United States, and it is important for a president to be able to connect and relate to all Americans.
97	Hillary Clinton accused Trump of being a racist, which Trump denies. Clinton has faced criticism for her comments and Trump noted that she was likely attempting to boost her own standing in the Democratic primary. He suggested that she was acting out of desperation and suggested that he was a better candidate than Bush. It appears that Trump believes that he is best positioned to win the nomination, as he has been successful in drawing attention to himself.
98	I don't agree with his methods, but it is important to recognize that President Trump has been honest in his approach. Unfortunately, this has not been received well by the public. If I were in his position, I would consider handing over the presidency now in order to allow the Democrats to take ownership of the situation and put their plans into action.
