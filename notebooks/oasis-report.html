        <p><strong class='text-danger'>Original Argument</strong></p>
        <p>The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap.
porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me.
its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.</p>

        <p>The argument that pornography can expose individuals to real-life scenarios, thereby increasing maturity and potentially preventing future sexual assaults, is not convincing. Pornography can lead to feelings of guilt due to the perceived waste of time, energy, and effort that could have been devoted elsewhere. It's a path that should be avoided, comparable to the harmful effects of smoking and drugs. One possible reason it's not banned in many developed countries could be due to their aging population.</p>

        <p>While I haven't personally experienced this, it seems like your friend could seek assistance through pro-bono or low-income legal services. It's surprising what some organizations consider as 'low income'. For instance, my sister's family, with a three-person household, earns approximately $46,000 annually. Despite this, they receive assistance from programs like W.I.C, daycare assistance, and food aid. I would suggest that she explore these services.</p>

        <div class='p-2  m-2'>
        <p><strong class='text-danger'>Original Argument</strong></p>
        <p>Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
Pick this apart at your will.</p>

        <p><strong class='text-success'>Neutralized</strong></p>
        <p>Sadism, defined as the act of inflicting pain or cruelty on others for personal or sexual satisfaction, is, in my view, the most reprehensible act a person can engage in. To carry out such an act, the victim must be in a position of vulnerability, which further intensifies the act of violence. This is indeed "evil".
However, in situations where all parties involved are consenting, I perceive this as a form of masochism, albeit facilitated by another person. While this may appear contradictory, if one seeks pain and violence and receives it from another, could this not be considered "assisted" masochism? (akin to assisted suicide) While these individuals may have unconventional preferences, the activities of consenting adults in private are not my concern.

        <p>I think we should be putting millions into research of doing cool animal combinations.  For example: a half gorilla half octopus.  Face is similar to an octopus and has 2 legs and 6 wavy arms and its also furry.

I don't buy the "don't play god" argument because I'm not worried about god smiting us for creating abominations.

Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering about your house.

Sure the research would cost a lot and some animals might get hurt but I really feel the end result would be worth it.</p>

        <p>I propose that significant funding should be allocated to research into the potential of creating unique animal combinations. For instance, envision a creature with the body of a gorilla and the facial features of an octopus. I reject the argument against 'playing god', as I do not fear divine retribution for such scientific advancements. Consider the possibility of a turtle with a chicken's head as a household pet. While acknowledging that the research may be costly and potentially harmful to some animals, I firmly believe that the end result could be revolutionary.</p>

Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. (And crime rates drop). And for the record, the second amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a governement that goes out of control. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.</p>

Some may view this as legislation that provides a sense of security. It's perceived as an effort to combat crime, while some argue it allows criminals to act freely.

Data suggests that criminals are less active when facing a well-armed citizen, leading to a drop in crime rates. The second amendment is not just about protecting hunting rights, but also about ensuring citizens can resist a government that becomes oppressive. The comparison of hunting rifles to machine guns highlights the disparity in firepower.</p>

If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are. 
We should teach morals not religion.

Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong? I'm not say rape is right just that consential sex with a girlfirend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a 'sin' is causing rape.</p>

If young men are taught that natural sexual urges, masturbation, consensual sex, and rape are all sinful, it can lead to confusion. We should focus on teaching ethics and morality, rather than religious dogma. Religion should not label natural feelings as wrong. Just as we wouldn't tell a woman that feeling cold is wrong, we shouldn't tell a man that acting on his natural sexual urges is wrong. It's important to distinguish between consensual sex and rape, and not label them both as 'sins'.</p>

        <p><strong class='text-danger'>Original Argument</strong></p>
        <p>In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)
Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.
Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.

        <p>In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more influential than women's general consensus, and it is a common stereotype that some men find lesbians appealing due to the absence of another man. (The opposite can be said for gay men.)
Furthermore, it is often perceived that gay women are more "socially acceptable," due to one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: the outdated belief that women are inferior to men.
Gay men face discrimination because of the misguided notion that romantic interest in men should be exclusive to women, and when a man participates, he is perceived as "lowering himself" to a woman's level.
Gay women, conversely, face less discrimination because romantic interest in women is traditionally seen as a man's attribute, which is mistakenly seen as conferring honor.

        <p>This guy's actually got a point. I'm not so sure on the specifics of any yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances may have tailed off over recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore it because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves.

        <p>The speaker raises a valid point. While I'm uncertain about the specifics of any involvement from Yahoo, it's undeniable that the Chinese government can be oppressive towards those who question its motives or policies. Although such instances may have decreased over recent years, harsh treatment remains a part of their protocol. The United States often overlooks this due to its focus on maintaining positive economic relations with China, despite the fact that much of the inexpensive labor we outsource there could be performed by individuals in forced labor conditions. It's crucial for us to acknowledge this reality.</p>

You do not see all the people (muslims) who are not suicide bombers protesting about the suicide bombers when Islam, so we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs...they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I don't see anybody protesting about that. 
I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole.

It's worth noting that not all Muslims are suicide bombers, and it's unfortunate that we don't see more protests against these violent acts, especially when Islam is often described as a peaceful religion. Suicide bombers show no respect for others' beliefs, even causing harm to fellow Muslims. I want to clarify that my comments are directed at suicide bombers, not Muslims as a whole.</p>

        <p>You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad shit will happen to you. Conversely you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. 

I see it everywhere, employers or bosses that treat some stuff like shit but are financially successful. People who do right by other people sometimes but get nothing in return.

I dont like it, but I see it often. If life were fair, inncocent people would not goto prison, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor.</p>

        <p>One can be a kind, compassionate individual and still face adversity. Conversely, one can lead a life of selfishness and still achieve success. Often, those who are successful have pursued their desires relentlessly and played to win. 

It's a common sight, employers or bosses who treat their staff poorly yet are financially successful. Individuals who act with integrity sometimes receive nothing in return.

It's a harsh reality, but it's frequently observed. If life were fair, innocent people would not be incarcerated, hard-working individuals would prosper, and virtuous people would not be impoverished.</p>

        <p>Scott Peterson was the white juxtapostion to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman." Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were nice looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us. 1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant. 2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?</p>

        <p>Scott Peterson's case drew parallels with OJ Simpson's, despite Peterson not being a celebrity but an "everyman." Like Simpson, he was accused of killing the mother of his children. However, the similarities end there. Peterson and his wife, Laci, were visually appealing, making for compelling TV images. The case was watched with the same intrigue as a thriller movie like Fatal Attraction. Peterson, an average individual, lost touch with reality, a common occurrence in cases of infidelity, especially when the spouse is pregnant. This served as a cautionary tale. 1) It's crucial not to lose sight of reality, thinking life will improve after committing such a heinous act. 2) Being an average individual doesn't exempt one from the consequences of their actions. It's a misconception that celebrity status can influence a jury's decision, regardless of the celebrity's race.</p>

        <p>Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.</p>

        <p>Drawing from my experience as a final year Engineering undergraduate, I have found the university environment to be less inspiring than expected. Over the course of three years, it appears that students are primarily being prepared to become a part of employment statistics for their respective departments, with little attention given to individual growth and passion. For instance, I undertook a self-proposed final year project, which I thoroughly enjoyed and was passionate about. However, it seemed that many of my peers were eager to complete their projects without much enthusiasm. This leads me to believe that universities may not be fulfilling their role in fostering a love for learning and serving humanity, but rather, they seem to be functioning more as a production line for the corporate world.</p>

        <p>bad company is boring its hard to kill people on there and the controls are weird the vehicles are boring and are hard to control for some reason also the maps are waaaaaaay to big.on cod the map called wastland is one of the biggest and people hate that map.mw2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering whats about to come from around that corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head or if your about to get hit by a thrown grenade but through all that that goes through your mind as your playing you get hit from behind and your down.battlefield is boring because you always no where the enemy is and you dont have to go get them you can just drive around being bored and the maps are to big to go out of your way to kill someone unlike on mw2 your thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to developed.plus weapons on mw2 are realistic except for the at4 which is not a guided munition.</p>

        <p>While some may find Bad Company 2 less engaging due to its perceived difficulty in eliminating opponents and unconventional controls, others may appreciate these aspects as they add a layer of complexity and realism to the game. The vehicles, although challenging to control, provide a unique gameplay experience. The expansive maps, while daunting to some, offer a vast battlefield that encourages strategic gameplay. In contrast, Call of Duty's map, Wasteland, is one of the largest and has received mixed reviews from players. Modern Warfare 2 is praised for its intense gameplay that keeps players on their toes, anticipating threats from every corner. However, in Bad Company 2, the predictability of enemy locations can be seen as a strategic advantage, allowing players to plan their moves accordingly. The large maps do not necessitate going out of one's way to engage an enemy, unlike in MW2 where players are thrust into survival mode with limited ammunition and skills that require time to develop. Lastly, while MW2's weapons are generally realistic, the AT4 is not a guided munition, which may detract from the game's authenticity.</p>

        <p>I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).</p>

        <p>Often, I hear discussions about the increased enforcement of the death penalty. While I am yet to form a firm stance on this issue, I perceive the death penalty as a societal form of retribution, akin to historical practices such as public beheadings. If this perception holds true, wouldn't it be beneficial for society to witness the consequences of a death sentence? This could serve to educate the public about the reality of executions in the United States, potentially influencing their views on the death penalty.</p>

        <p>You can't export Democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government.  Muslim countries do not have the Enlightenment background we had in the nascent United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic.  Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran.  Despite the attempts by some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience.  Islam needs to go through their own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed.  Until then we can only keep (weak) control by military force which sets up blowback as we now see in the Middle East.</p>

        <p>Imposing democracy by force is not effective as it requires the collective will of the people to establish such a government. Countries with a predominantly Muslim population may not have the same historical context as the United States, which was influenced by the Enlightenment to form a secular Constitutional Republic. The principle of Islam integrates religion and state, with the rule of law derived from the Quran. In contrast, the United States maintains a separation between religion and state, allowing citizens to follow their conscience. For a western-style democracy to have a chance of success, there may need to be a cultural shift similar to the Enlightenment. Until such a shift occurs, maintaining control through military force may only lead to backlash, as evidenced by current events in the Middle East.</p>

        <p>Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).

The argument is that it's considerate but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out. 

And in a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again. 

Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.</p>

        <p>I've never personally encountered this issue with a significant other, but I have experienced it in an office building and while staying with a female friend. I understand the latter situation because it's her house and she has a certain way she wants it maintained.

The argument is that it's considerate to put the seat down, but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never discussed. If it were, it would essentially nullify the entire argument.

In a large building or household, the next person to use the toilet could be a male who needs to urinate, in which case he would need to put the seat up again.

Lastly, it seems unreasonable to use a shared toilet without checking it first, while expecting male users to do the checking for both themselves and the women.</p>

        <p>You r wrong my dear they havent been shut down in India, the ban is only in Maharastra. The Gov had shut down because the gov had received many a compliants from the housewifes about their male familly members wasting money on ladies bars and not looking after the families. Also many criminal activities took place at this bars. U must be knowing the tarannum case, or telgi case where tarannum monthly income was arouned 1 lac and telgi would throw away nereby 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on shuch type of criminal activities the Gov of Maharastra had put a ban on these ladies bar</p>

        <p>It's not accurate to say that ladies bars have been shut down across India; the ban is specific to Maharashtra. The government implemented this ban after receiving numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members squandering money at these bars and neglecting their familial responsibilities. Additionally, these bars were often the sites of criminal activities. Cases like the Tarannum and Telgi cases, where Tarannum's monthly income was around 1 lakh and Telgi reportedly spent nearly 1 lakh per day on bar girls, are examples of such activities. To curb these criminal activities, the Maharashtra government imposed a ban on ladies bars.</p>

        <p>Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman. If two people of the same sex choose to live together, that's their personal choice. However, the question of whether they should receive tax benefits is a separate issue. It's important to ensure that all viewpoints are expressed respectfully, without imposing them on others, especially children. The belief that homosexuality is a learned behavior is subjective and not universally accepted. The public exposure of any group should be handled with care to maintain societal morality. If societal morality is compromised, it could have serious implications for society.</p>

        <p>Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices their( the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker section of the skyrim story. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist they abuse and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morales and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head of at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains.</p>

        <p>My argument is that the portrayal of the Stormcloaks as the unequivocal villains in the conflict between them and the Empire weakens the narrative of the Skyrim story. Let's examine why the Stormcloaks are depicted as negative. They are portrayed as racist, mistreating those who are different, which by contemporary moral standards, labels them as evil and casts them, particularly Ulfric, as the antagonists. Furthermore, Ulfric used the Thu'um to kill the High King, essentially employing an ancient and powerful gift for a malevolent act. This further cements the Stormcloaks as the apparent villains, with no redeeming qualities, except for not being the ones who wanted to execute you at the start. I invite you to change my view by demonstrating that the Stormcloaks are not merely one-dimensional villains.</p>

        <p><strong class='text-danger'>Original Argument</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. 

For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.

I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]

Edit: I'm talking about car insurance.</p>

        <p>I acknowledge the studies indicating that young men can be more reckless than women, but I don't believe this should justify differential treatment between the genders. 

Consider this analogy: Whites constitute 78 percent of the U.S. population and account for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, represent 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, account for 21 percent of the state prison population. Should Blacks or Hispanics be treated differently because they are statistically overrepresented in prison? I believe not. This analogy illustrates why I think men should receive the same insurance rates as women.

I'm not advocating for men's rights exclusively, but I find this situation unjust. I welcome differing viewpoints! Thank you for your time.

Note: My argument pertains to car insurance.</p>

        <p>So you dispute the Pontias Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter.
Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie.
And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.
And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption.
The whole controversey is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eye witness accounts claim that he did. What can you say to prove that he didn't?</p>

        <p>Are you questioning the account of Pontius Pilate and the testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes are you suggesting Jesus committed? It is documented that the Pharisees and Jewish leaders pleaded with Pilate to release a criminal in order to persecute Jesus. Pilate's wife also pleaded for Jesus' release. Pilate himself was remorseful and did not sentence Jesus, instead he absolved himself of the situation.
You refer to Jesus as a 'hippie', however, 'nomad' might be a more accurate term. In that context, he was similar to other nomadic individuals or tribes of the time. Most had long hair (except for Roman citizens), and wore togas or other robes. Sandals were the common footwear. Labeling Jesus as a 'hippie', let alone the first 'hippie', seems unjustified.
According to historical accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.
The assumption that Jesus was married is unfounded.
The central controversy revolves around whether or not He resurrected. There are eye witness accounts claiming that he did. What evidence do you have to refute this?</p>

        <p>No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.

However there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.</p>

        <p>Nothing is inherently bad or good. It is the manner in which it is used, implemented, and perceived that determines its value. In India, reservation has been used as a political tool to garner votes, whether it's the SC&ST provisions in the constitution, originally intended for 15 years, or the implementation of the Mandal commission after years of dormancy. Reservation has many facets. It's undeniable that certain sections of society require assistance to rise from their current state of poverty or backwardness.

However, there is opposition to reservation because the benefits are not reaching the intended recipients. Instead, they are being exploited by individuals from these communities who are already in a higher class, while the truly needy remain in the same position. No one would object if the truly needy received the benefits. The frustration arises when those who are not in need reap the benefits.</p>

        <p>It's not accurate to say that all foreigners are disliked. The sentiment might vary depending on the country of origin. Just like anywhere in the world, there are preferred and less preferred nations. The less preferred nations are usually aware of their status and the reasons behind it. If a nation is perceived as violent, dishonest, or harmful to the global community, it might not be well-received. This is because a government is seen as a representation of its people. Therefore, the actions of a government can impact the perception of its citizens.</p>

        <p>Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech.

However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries.

However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?</p>

        <p>Yes, freedom of speech should be unrestricted. However, it should not be manipulated to the point where it loses its essence. Freedom of speech is closely tied to personal responsibility and accountability. The creation of certain cartoons, while legal, was not responsible, considering the potential for unrest in certain regions. It's also worth noting that the reaction from some parts of the Islamic world seems disproportionate. This reaction could potentially harm their credibility. It's important to remember that there are numerous parody websites about various religions, yet not all followers react with violence.</p>

        <p>It's unclear whether you're referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. It's common for individuals born south of the USA, who share Spanish as their native language, to have similar accents when speaking English. However, it's important to note that not all "Latinos" are the same; Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, for instance, have distinct cultures compared to the rest of Latin America. Just as one wouldn't label an Irish person as British, a Canadian as American, or a Basque as Spanish, it's crucial to respect cultural differences. Culture should not be used as an excuse for inappropriate behavior. When residing in another country, it's essential to learn and respect its customs and traditions. Using culture as a justification for certain actions can be seen as an attempt to evade responsibility.</p>

        <p>I believe that the decision to ban smoking should not be a government choice, but rather the choice of the property owner. I have not been in a situation where smoke has bothered me, as most establishments are non-smoking. Even in bars in Ohio, where smoking is more prevalent, it does not bother me. The only inconvenience is the smell on my clothes and hair the next day, which is comparable to the smell of alcohol after a night of drinking. This ban seems like a method of control and a way to generate revenue. For instance, the ballot mentions a 'clean air fund'. If smoking is banned, why would there be a need for such a fund? What would the money be used for? I would rather my money be invested in my child's college fund. If this ban passes, I won't have that choice, will I?</p>

        <p>(pause here for deeply bitter laugh)...What an excellent question! Let's see, this is a poor woman? An immigrant? Not a middle class white woman?A woman whose family is not being torn to shreds over an agonizing decision about which they don't agree? This isn't an election year? The Shrub is in enough hot water with the public without having this situation getting the same headlines that Schiavo's case garnered? In any case, while I agree whole heartedly with your implication that the "Culture of Life" folks are a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites, I find that I am a little grateful that this lady was permitted to die without being at the center of a terrible storm of public controversy played out among people who don't even know her.Cold comfort, but it's all I have some days. I'm very grateful she had family with her, shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her mother.</p>

        <p>This is indeed an intriguing question. Could it be because the woman in question is not of middle-class white descent? Or perhaps because her family is not embroiled in a public disagreement over a painful decision? Could it be that it's not an election year, and the current administration is already facing enough public scrutiny without this case attracting the same attention as Schiavo's? While I concur with your suggestion that the 'Culture of Life' advocates may be politically motivated, I am somewhat relieved that this woman was allowed to pass away without becoming the focus of a public controversy among people who didn't even know her. It's a small consolation, but sometimes that's all one has. It's heartening that she had family with her, although it's regrettable that compassion didn't prompt anyone to wait for her mother.</p>

        <p>The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commision as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous water cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.</p>

        <p>The United States boasts one of the most formidable navies globally, with a total of 366 military ships currently in commission. However, only four of these ships are deployed in areas prone to pirate attacks, which span thousands of nautical miles. Given the vastness of these waters, it is questionable whether four ships can provide effective protection. As the world's most powerful navy, the U.S. could potentially allocate more ships to safeguard trade routes and countries in this region. The alternative is to maintain the current deployment and risk further ship hijackings, a scenario I find less preferable. Every day, hundreds of ships traverse these perilous waters, some even carrying aid to developing nations. Is it politically justifiable to leave these trade routes vulnerable to danger and hostility? I believe not.</p>

People are free to make there own decisions in life. Yeah, maybe it sucks that there is such big consequences to it, but really you sound stupid! Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty.  Maybe you should teach your kids about responsiblity and learn to talk to them about it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discouage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.</p>

I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis.

        <p>The establishment of Israel is often justified by the need to safeguard people of Jewish heritage globally. However, the question arises, why should an Israeli state be established in a historically significant but potentially volatile location due to an ancient claim? Would it not have been more feasible to allocate a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government was involved in the persecution of Jews, and promote acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? It's important to note that not all Germans were involved in the actions of the Nazis. Nevertheless, the allocation of a part of Germany could arguably be more morally justifiable than the contentious establishment in Palestine due to a religious claim. If the security of Jewish people is the concern, designating a part of Germany as a new Israeli state could have been a more viable option. CMV.</p>

        <p>I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.

Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.

That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.

And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.</p>

        <p>While I may not be fully versed in this particular case, I hold the view that laws named after individuals can be problematic, as the proponents may be driven more by emotion and grief than by rational thought.

A well-crafted law should have safeguards and rational provisions to ensure that the actions deemed illegal are indeed the ones posing a threat. I am generally against laws that criminalize actions merely because they could potentially cause harm when combined with other actions. My belief is in penalizing those who actually cause harm, rather than restricting actions based on mere speculation.

However, it's worth noting that the legislative process has become increasingly emotional. Both voters and legislators often pass laws based on their immediate reactions, frequently without considering the potential consequences or long-term effects. Unfortunately, logic and reason seem to have taken a backseat to sensationalism.

Regrettably, this trend doesn't seem likely to reverse in the near future. Best of luck.</p>

        <p>From an ethical standpoint, if your father's insurance premium increases, you should contribute to it. It's likely to be reviewed within six months. However, this can be viewed as a life lesson. You received a ticket for improper passing, which isn't a major issue. The other party also received a ticket, indicating shared responsibility. Let's consider a large medical bill. You're likely covered under your father's policy if you were at fault. The issue lies with your friend who is primarily responsible. He allowed you to use the car. Now, if a large claim arises, he isn't insured because he didn't list you as a separate driver, and he may have to pay out of pocket. This is his issue, not yours. I don't perceive this as an ethical dilemma for you, as you are insured.</p>

The crux of my parents' argument is that family is transient and they would go to great lengths for me. However, their willingness to help doesn't necessarily engender affection or obligation on my part. It's akin to a distant acquaintance expressing a similar sentiment. Just because this acquaintance is willing to assist me, doesn't mean I am obliged to reciprocate with affection or care. I neither desire nor require their assistance.

        <p>Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.

Your Friend,
Francesois

        <p>Dear Participant,

I believe the premise of your question may need some clarification. Racial profiling involves a systematic suspicion of specific minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all customers of a particular race more than others based on the assumption that they are more prone to accidents, they would likely face legal consequences.

However, law enforcement personnel, who have the power to use force, incarcerate individuals, and potentially disrupt the lives of innocent people, are held to a higher standard. Insurance companies, on the other hand, provide a service that can be obtained from numerous competitors. Therefore, discriminatory practices in law enforcement have far-reaching implications compared to those in the insurance industry.

Sincerely,
Participant</p>

        <p>One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I pissed. Over time I began to do it more often. Now I muti-task quite often by sitting to piss while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to piss when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean tha it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.</p>

        <p>One morning, I was in a rush and had to urinate. I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I urinated sitting down. A few days later, I was feeling unwell and decided to sit while I urinated. Over time, I began to do it more often. Now, I multi-task quite often by sitting to urinate while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to urinate when I'm feeling tired. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't shared this with anyone because it might be considered unconventional. I also do it when I wake up with an erection and have to urinate, so I can position myself comfortably under the toilet seat. As you may know, trying to urinate with an erection can be challenging. Just because women have to do it doesn't mean that it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with sexual orientation because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.</p>

        <p>Firstly does your bf own the company or is he a worker?

Secondly unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your bf has done something like cross a picket line , then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab.  As for the other man is he really an illegal allien?  Then INS could come in and send him back .

You know unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecing the work they do.  When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group.

Unions are not all demons nor is management always the enemy however if that's how management and union posture themselves then there won't be any kind of labour peace.</p>

        <p>Firstly, does the individual in question own the company or is he an employee?

Secondly, unions are legal and have the right to recruit members. However, this situation seems to be a bit extreme, unless the individual has done something like crossing a picket line. In that case, he should be aware that he might not be well-received or respected, which could explain the derogatory terms used against him. Regarding the other individual, if he is indeed an undocumented immigrant, then immigration authorities could intervene.

It's important to note that unionism tends to grow when employees feel that management is not treating them fairly or respecting their work. When people do not feel valued or acknowledged for their contributions, they may become frustrated and retaliate as a collective.

Unions are not inherently bad, nor is management always the adversary. However, if both parties position themselves as such, it could disrupt labor peace.</p>

        <p>Throughout the debate with the Washington Redskins I keep hearing the argument that a teamed named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of having a team named the Detroit N*****s.

This to me is illogical: First off when has anyone every heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context.

        <p>Throughout the debate regarding the Washington Redskins, I often encounter the argument that having a team named the Washington Redskins is akin to having a team named with a racial slur used against African Americans. This seems illogical to me: When has anyone ever heard the term 'Redskin' outside of the context of the professional football team? Has anyone used the term 'Redskin' as a derogatory term? I am uncertain if it is a racist term, but for the sake of argument, let's assume it is. However, the term 'Redskin' is not similar to the racial slur used against African Americans, based on the context in which it is used. CMV</p>

        <p>I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.</p>

        <p>I propose that personal pursuits are superior endeavors. Prioritizing personal pursuits does not necessarily mean neglecting others. For instance, if a family member requires assistance, it is natural to help them out. This is not just because they are related by blood, but because they are part of our personal sphere. Similarly, when faced with a choice between helping a stranger or a family member, it is likely that we would choose the latter. This does not diminish the value of helping strangers, but rather highlights the importance of personal connections in our pursuits.</p>

        <p>There is no provision in either document you cite which says keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom.

Now, our founding fathers were involved in colony govts before they were involved in rebellion.  In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan.  We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good.  We also had courts to help protect our rights.  

When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation, we were not opposed to taxation.  We never have been.

You have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society.   Plus, you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.</p>

        <p>Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.
Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.</p>

        <p>From an ethical standpoint, it's not acceptable for anyone to infringe on the privacy of an innocent individual. The act of pursuing celebrities can be seen as intrusive and potentially harmful, and there have been numerous legal actions against photographers and media outlets. However, citizens have a right to be informed about the actions of their government, as it is funded by their taxes. It's important to note that the government's access to personal information has increased over time, diminishing the protections of the 4th Amendment. This includes social security numbers, firearm records, expanded search and seizure practices, phone surveillance, and the pressure on businesses to share private data with government agencies.</p>

        <p>It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house. That's for the lucky ones of course.
