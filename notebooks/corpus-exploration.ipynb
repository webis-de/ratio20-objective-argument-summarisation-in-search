Crimes are crimes, and some, can be forgiven with hard work and a real change.  I am an NCO and I have seen troops grow up and take their duty and the rules seriously.  You can change, even if you get discharged.  You can ALWAYS choose the right path, just hope it is not to late, like for Tookie Williams.  Chose to change too late.   \n",

This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher over a couple of days, and the older plates have already dried up. You have to take the still dirty plates and clean them manually.\\r\\n- dishwashers don't properly dry \"deep\" items like Tupperware and pots, if you aren't careful taking these out, you'll get everything else wet, once again making the process useless. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think overall that dishwashers are overrated, undercapable, overpriced appliances that have no place in a modern kitchen.   \n",

Guantanamo was an excellent example.  While the inmates were humiliated, they weren't tortured.  The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture.  So, if you feed them, it's torture.  If you don't and they starve, it's torture.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.   \n",
